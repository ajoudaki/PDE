# Training-law stability for two hidden tanh layers

This study proves a local quantitative statement about the actual nonlinear
learning algorithm. The proof retains the Gaussian matrix action and its
adjoint and permits every training law on the compact observation space.

Fix Y>0. Inputs are `x(alpha)=sqrt(2)(cos(alpha),sin(alpha))` in R²;
`u=x/sqrt(2)` and `G(x,x')=u·u'`. The observation space is
`Z=sqrt(2) S^1 x [-Y,Y]`, with metric
`d_Z((x,y),(x',y'))=|x-x'|/sqrt(2)+|y-y'|`. The Wasserstein distance
`W1(mu,nu)` is the infimum over couplings of the expectation of this metric.
No restriction is imposed on atom counts, atom weights, correlations,
coincident inputs, labels conditional on input, or Gram ranks.

The finite network has equal hidden width n, no biases, and

\[
 z^1(x)=W^{(1)}x/\sqrt2,\quad h^1(x)=\tanh z^1(x),\quad
 z^2(x)=W^{(2)}h^1(x),\quad h^2(x)=\tanh z^2(x),\quad
 f_n(x)=(W^{(3)})^Th^2(x)/n.
\]

All entries and blocks are independent initially, with variances
`W^(1):1`, `W^(2):1/n`, `W^(3):1/n²`, and zero Gaussian means. All blocks
train by mean squared loss, with stored-weight mobilities `(n,1,n)`.
Raw GD updates all blocks from the same preceding state, with physical
step eta. Parameters are interpolated linearly and forward quantities are
recomputed. Initialization is independent of random training observations.

**Theorem.** There exist `T_*>0`, `C<infinity` depending only on Y and this
fixed model, with the following properties.

1. On common canonical Gaussian action spaces there is a strong autonomous
   population flow for every law mu. Its state is a full first-row field
   `w in L²(Omega_1;R²)`, a bounded action
   `A: L²(Omega_1)->L²(Omega_2)` and stored readout `c in L²(Omega_2)`.
   Its initialized action is the actual joint forward/transpose limit of
   the Gaussian middle matrix, and its reverse is the Hilbert adjoint.
   Initial state is `(g,A_0,0)` with `g~N(0,I_2)`; the finite random
   readout is retained and has vanishing normalized RMS. The integral
   equations are (P3)–(P5) below. The state is continuously differentiable
   in the sum of full-row L², action operator norm and readout L²; it is
   unique among strong continuous integral solutions on these initialized
   spaces. At reached states it is uniquely restartable on the remaining
   local interval in the stated bounded-state class. Learned action
   increments are Hilbert–Schmidt, while the initialized action need not be.

2. For `0<q=W1(mu,nu)<=1`, the entire state and all forward hidden fields
   obey the modulus `Cq exp(C sqrt(log(e/q)))` in their stated norms,
   uniformly in time, and the forward fields uniformly in input. In
   particular

   \[
   \sup_{t\le T_*,\,x\in\sqrt2S^1}|f_\mu(t,x)-f_\nu(t,x)|
   \le Cq\exp(C\sqrt{\log(e/q)}).
   \]

   For q=0 the flows agree. For q>1 their predictions differ by at most
   2B, where B is the fixed common state bound defined in the proof. No
   logarithmic expression is evaluated beyond its stated domain.

3. Let `mu_S=m^(-1) sum_i delta_(x_i,y_i)` and `f_S=f_mu_S`. Samples
   differing in one observation satisfy

   \[
   \sup_{t\le T_*,x}|f_S(t,x)-f_{S'}(t,x)|
   \le\frac C m\exp(C\sqrt{\log(em)}).
   \]

   Define `R_mu(g)=int (g(x)-y)² dmu` and
   `Rhat_S(g)=m^(-1)sum_i(g(x_i)-y_i)²`. For iid observations from mu,

   \[
   \sup_{t\le T_*}\left|\mathbb E_S
   [R_\mu(f_S(t))-\widehat R_S(f_S(t))]\right|
   \le\frac C m\exp(C\sqrt{\log(em)}).
   \]

   The expectation and time supremum have exactly this order.

4. For every deterministic sequence of empirical laws lambda_k converging
   in W1 to mu, every `n_k->infinity`, and every `eta_k->0`, actual finite
   GD satisfies

   \[
   \sup_{t\le T_*,x}|f_{n_k,\eta_k,\lambda_k}(t,x)-f_\mu(t,x)|
     \longrightarrow0\quad\hbox{in probability}.
   \]

   In particular this holds for iid samples of any sizes m_k tending to
   infinity, independent of initialization. No relative growth restriction
   is required among n_k, m_k and eta_k. The finite empirical training loss
   and population risk both converge uniformly in time, in probability,
   to `R_mu(f_mu(t))`. This assertion also retains the paired initial/current
   activation displacement observations described next.

5. Define

   \[
   J_\ell(\mu,t)=\int\mathbb E_\ell
   |H^\ell_\mu(t,x)-H^\ell_0(x)|^2\,d\mu(x,y),\qquad\ell=1,2.
   \]

   For the reference
   `mu_0=½ delta_(sqrt(2)e1,Y/2)+½ delta_(sqrt(2)e2,Y/2)` there are a
   specified positive time t_0<=T_*, a radius r_0>0 and j_0>0, defined
   from its actual flow in Part IV, such that
   `J_ell(mu,t_0)>=j_0/2` for both layers whenever
   `W1(mu,mu_0)<r_0`. For the finite networks in assertion 4 converging
   to any such mu, both corresponding training-averaged squared RMS
   displacements exceed j_0/4 with probability tending to one. The family
   is open relative to all admissible laws and contains correlated and
   nonatomic laws.

The conclusion concerns finite-time training-law stability with genuine
nonlinear hidden learning. It does not assert activity for every law,
fitting, endpoint selection, a risk reduction, excess-risk control,
feature-learning superiority, global-time control, or quantitative
finite-width replacement or approximation rates.

The proof first compares changed-law vector fields using only weighted
individual reference tails. It builds the common strong flow by completing
finite training laws in the full state topology, then compares actual GD
directly to a fixed finite reference oracle. A ghost-sample exchange proves
the precise statistical assertion. Finally an actual-flow expansion and
positive adjunction identity give nonzero representation displacement,
which state continuity transfers to an open family. Complete Gaussian and
response dependencies accompany the frozen proof packet.
