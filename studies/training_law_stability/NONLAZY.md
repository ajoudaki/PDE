# A finite-time open family with motion in both hidden representations

This proof concerns the model in this study: two tanh hidden layers, `d=2`,
Gaussian initialization of stored weights with variances `(1,1/n,1/n^2)`,
mobilities `(n,1,n)`, mean squared loss, and physical time. Its reference-flow
calculation is unconditional under the established finite-data local theorem
in `docs/global_nonlinear.md` C.1. The open-law and simultaneous-width
conclusions use the state-continuity and observable-convergence conclusions
proved in this study's other components, explicitly identified below. This
file alone does not establish those conclusions.

The argument uses a positive-time consequence of the integral equations,
then continuity of an averaged activation displacement. It requires no
lower bound on a Gram eigenvalue for the full class of laws. The particular
reference below has orthogonal inputs; its open neighborhood permits all
admissible laws sufficiently close to it, including correlated and nonatomic
laws.

## 1. State and observables

Put `u=x/sqrt(2)`, so `|u|=1`. On the compatible common Gaussian spaces of
the population construction, write the first row field as
`w_mu(t) in L2(Omega_1;R^2)`, the middle action as `W_mu^(2)(t)`, and the
stored readout as `W_mu^(3)(t)`. Define

\[
 Z_\mu^{(1)}(t,x)=w_\mu(t)\cdot u,\quad
 H_\mu^{(1)}(t,x)=\tanh Z_\mu^{(1)}(t,x),\qquad
 Z_\mu^{(2)}(t,x)=W_\mu^{(2)}(t)H_\mu^{(1)}(t,x),\quad
 H_\mu^{(2)}(t,x)=\tanh Z_\mu^{(2)}(t,x).
\]

The initialization is common to all laws: `w_0=(g_1,g_2)` with independent
standard Gaussians, `W_0^(2)` the actual Gaussian matrix action with its
adjoint, and `W_0^(3)=0`. Write `H_0^(ell)(x)` for the initialized activation.
For `ell=1,2` define the training-input averaged squared displacement and RMS
displacement

\[
 J_\ell(\mu,t)=\int_{\mathcal Z}
 \|H_\mu^{(\ell)}(t,x)-H_0^{(\ell)}(x)\|_{L^2(\Omega_\ell)}^2
 \,\mu(dx,dy),\qquad
 A_\ell(\mu,t)=\sqrt{J_\ell(\mu,t)}.                       \tag{1}
\]

The coordinate pairing at the two times is the same neuron population,
not an arbitrary coupling of the two activation marginal laws. Since tanh
is bounded by one, `0<=J_ell<=4`.

The common bounded-state interval supplies a deterministic `B>=1` such that
`||w_mu(t)||_2<=B` and `||W_mu^(2)(t)||_op<=B` for all laws and times under
consideration, including initialization. The 1-Lipschitz property of tanh
then gives, with `rho(x,x')=|x-x'|/sqrt(2)`,

\[
 \|H_\mu^{(1)}(t,x)-H_\mu^{(1)}(t,x')\|_2\le B\rho(x,x'),
 \qquad
 \|H_\mu^{(2)}(t,x)-H_\mu^{(2)}(t,x')\|_2\le B^2\rho(x,x').   \tag{2}
\]

Thus one may use `K=B^2` in both layers, for all laws, times and initialization.
These estimates use the full first-row field; controlling only projections
on a fixed training list would not justify them.

## 2. An explicit reference law and actual-flow expansion

Fix `y_0=Y/2>0` and

\[
 x_1=\sqrt2(1,0),\qquad x_2=\sqrt2(0,1),\qquad
 \mu_0=\tfrac12\delta_{(x_1,y_0)}+
       \tfrac12\delta_{(x_2,y_0)},\qquad p=y_0/2=Y/4.          \tag{3}
\]

The Gram is `G=I_2`, and `p` is the label multiplied by its atom weight.
All constants below may depend on this reference and on `Y`.
Suppress `mu_0` in the notation. Set

\[
 h_a=\tanh g_a,\qquad q_0=\mathbb E\tanh^2 g_1>0,
 \qquad \xi_a=W_0^{(2)}h_a\quad (a=1,2).
\]

Oddness and independence of the lower Gaussian roots give
`E[h_a h_b]=q_0 1_(a=b)`. The first forward Gaussian calculation gives
independent `xi_1,xi_2~N(0,q_0)` in the second population. This calculation
can also be read directly at finite width: conditioned on the first-layer
arrays, each row output is Gaussian with covariance
`(h_a^T h_b/n)_(a,b)`, which converges to `q_0 I_2`; row averages of bounded
continuous functions concentrate conditionally, and Gaussian second moments
give the same conclusion for quadratic-growth tests. No trained matrix has
been replaced by an independent map.

Let `b(s)=sech^2(s)=tanh'(s)` and define the following fields, each in its
displayed layer:

\[
 S=p(\tanh\xi_1+\tanh\xi_2),\qquad U_a=S b(\xi_a)
       \quad\hbox{in }L^2(\Omega_2),
\]
\[
 P_a=(W_0^{(2)})^*U_a,\qquad
 T_a=p b(g_a)P_a,\qquad C_a=p b(g_a)^2P_a
       \quad\hbox{in }L^2(\Omega_1),
\]
\[
 M_a=pq_0U_a,\qquad R_a=M_a+W_0^{(2)}C_a,\qquad
 E_a=b(\xi_a)R_a
       \quad\hbox{in }L^2(\Omega_2).                       \tag{4}
\]

All these fields are well defined: `S,U_a` are bounded, the initial action
and its adjoint are bounded on the generated `L2` spaces, and every remaining
multiplier is bounded. The exact weighted physical equations are

\[
 \dot Z_a^{(1)}=-\sum_b G_{ab}r_b\delta_b^{(1)},\qquad
 \dot W^{(2)}=-\sum_b r_b\delta_b^{(2)}\otimes H_b^{(1)},
 \qquad \dot W^{(3)}=-\sum_b r_bH_b^{(2)},                 \tag{5}
\]

where `r_b=f_b-y_0`, `delta_b^(2)=W^(3)b(Z_b^(2))` and
`delta_b^(1)=b(Z_b^(1))(W^(2))*delta_b^(2)`. The factors in (5) are
`-2 omega_b=-1`, since this is a two-point mean loss.

The strong integral equations and continuity give

\[
 \begin{aligned}
 W^{(3)}(t)&=2tS+o_{L^2}(t),&
 \delta_a^{(2)}(t)&=2tU_a+o_{L^2}(t),\\
 \delta_a^{(1)}(t)&=2t b(g_a)P_a+o_{L^2}(t),&
 Z_a^{(1)}(t)-g_a&=2t^2T_a+o_{L^2}(t^2),\\
 H_a^{(1)}(t)-h_a&=2t^2C_a+o_{L^2}(t^2),&
 W^{(2)}(t)-W_0^{(2)}
   &=2t^2\sum_b p U_b\otimes h_b+o_{\rm op}(t^2),\\
 Z_a^{(2)}(t)-\xi_a&=2t^2R_a+o_{L^2}(t^2),&
 H_a^{(2)}(t)-\tanh\xi_a&=2t^2E_a+o_{L^2}(t^2).
 \end{aligned}                                                        \tag{6}
\]

Here is the justification of every passage needed for (6). Divide the
readout integral in (5) by `t` and use `r_b(0)=-y_0`, continuity and
`H_b^(2)(0)=tanh xi_b`. The limit is `y_0 sum_b tanh xi_b=2S`.
If `V_t->V` in `L2` and `a_t->a` in probability with uniformly bounded
`a_t`, then `a_t V_t->a V` in `L2`: bound the part multiplying `V_t-V`
by the uniform multiplier bound, and split the part multiplying `V` at
`|V|<=M`, then let `M` increase. Apply this fact to `b(Z_a^(2)(t))`, and
then to the continuous adjoint and lower gate. It gives the two backward
limits in (6). Integrating `s` times a field converging in `L2` uses
`integral_0^t s ds=t^2/2`, which proves the lower preactivation and matrix
limits, including their factors `2p`.

For either activation difference use the identity

\[
 \frac{\tanh(z+v_t)-\tanh z}{t^2}
 =\frac{v_t}{t^2}\int_0^1 b(z+s v_t)\,ds.
\]

If `v_t/t^2` converges in `L2`, its right side converges to the limit
multiplied by `b(z)`, by the bounded-multiplier argument. Finally expand
`W(t)H_a(t)-W_0h_a` as `(W(t)-W_0)h_a+W_0(H_a(t)-h_a)` plus the product of
the two increments; the latter is `O_L2(t^4)`. The matrix term is
`2t^2 sum_b p U_b E[h_bh_a]=2t^2 M_a`. This gives the upper two limits.
These steps derive (6) along the existing actual flow; no formal power-series
existence argument is used.

## 3. Strict positivity of both activation displacements

Actual adjunction and independence of the upper initial Gaussian coordinates
give, for each `a`,

\[
 \langle h_a,P_a\rangle_1
 =\langle\xi_a,U_a\rangle_2
 =p\,\mathbb E[\xi_a\tanh\xi_a\,b(\xi_a)]>0.             \tag{7}
\]

The other summand in `S` contributes zero, since its tanh has mean zero and
is independent of `xi_a`. In the remaining expectation the integrand is
strictly positive whenever `xi_a!=0`; the nondegenerate Gaussian gives
probability one to that event. It is integrable because it is at most
`|xi_a|`. Thus `P_a` is nonzero in `L2`. Since `p>0` and `b(g_a)>0` almost
surely, `C_a=p b(g_a)^2 P_a` is also nonzero. In particular

\[
 c_1^2=\tfrac12\sum_{a=1}^2\|C_a\|_2^2>0.               \tag{8}
\]

For the upper layer, adjunction yields the positive identity

\[
 \begin{aligned}
 p\sum_a\langle U_a,R_a\rangle_2
 &=p^2q_0\sum_a\|U_a\|_2^2
   +p\sum_a\langle P_a,C_a\rangle_1\\
 &=p^2q_0\sum_a\|U_a\|_2^2
   +p^2\sum_a\mathbb E[b(g_a)^2 P_a^2]>0.                \tag{9}
 \end{aligned}
\]

Its left side is `p sum_a E[S E_a]`. Consequently the `E_a` cannot all
vanish in `L2`, and

\[
 c_2^2=\tfrac12\sum_{a=1}^2\|E_a\|_2^2>0.               \tag{10}
\]

This proves precisely the averaged upper-layer assertion needed here; an
individual upper-input activity assertion is unnecessary. Formula (9) also
retains both upper-preactivation contributions, from the moving middle
matrix and from the moving lower representation.

By (6), (8) and (10),

\[
 A_\ell(\mu_0,t)=2c_\ell t^2+o(t^2),\qquad \ell=1,2.     \tag{11}
\]

There exists `tau in (0,T_*]` such that
`A_ell(mu_0,t)>=c_ell t^2` for both layers and all `0<t<=tau`.
For a completely specified choice from the actual reference solution, let
`s_0` be the supremum of `s in (0,T_*]` such that

\[
 \left|t^{-2}A_\ell(\mu_0,t)-2c_\ell\right|\le c_\ell
 \quad(\ell=1,2;\ 0<t\le s).
\]

Equation (11) gives `s_0>0`; take `tau=s_0/2` and the fixed positive
observation time `t_0=tau/2`. No explicit numeric lower bound on `t_0` is
claimed. The constants `c_ell` are the positive Gaussian-action expressions
(8), (10), rather than fitted or numerically selected quantities.

## 4. Transport continuity and the open family

The state theorem needed from the other proof components is this precise
conclusion: on common generated Gaussian spaces, for `q=W_1(mu,nu)<=1`,

\[
 \sup_{t\le T_*}\bigl(\|w_\mu(t)-w_\nu(t)\|_2+
 \|W_\mu^{(2)}(t)-W_\nu^{(2)}(t)\|_{\rm op}\bigr)
 \le C\,\omega(q),\qquad
 \omega(q)=q\exp(C\sqrt{\log(e/q)}),\quad\omega(0)=0.       \tag{12}
\]

It suffices equally to use any established modulus tending to zero in (12).
The forward formulas on the bounded state ball imply

\[
 \sup_{t,x,\ell}
 \|H_\mu^{(\ell)}(t,x)-H_\nu^{(\ell)}(t,x)\|_2
 \le C_H\omega(q).                                      \tag{13}
\]

Indeed the lower difference is bounded by the first-row difference; the
upper preactivation difference is at most the matrix difference times
`||H_mu^(1)||_2<=1`, plus `B` times the lower difference. Applying tanh
preserves these bounds.

To compare (1), first hold the training law fixed and change the evolved
state. Each activation displacement has norm at most two, so its squared
norm changes by at most `4C_H omega(q)`. Next hold the state `nu` fixed
and change the averaging law. Equation (2) bounds the difference of
displacement fields at `x,x'` by `2K rho(x,x')`; therefore their squared
norms differ by at most `8K rho(x,x')`. Integrating against any coupling
of `mu,nu` and taking the infimum gives

\[
 \sup_{t\le T_*}|J_\ell(\mu,t)-J_\ell(\nu,t)|
 \le 4C_H\omega(q)+8Kq,\qquad\ell=1,2.                  \tag{14}
\]

The joint transport cost dominates `rho`; labels need not be deterministic
functions of inputs for this argument. Approximate minimizers suffice, so
existence of an optimal coupling need not be invoked. The same proof is
valid for atoms, coincident inputs and singular Grams.

Set `j_0=min(c_1^2,c_2^2)t_0^4>0`. Choose a radius `r_0 in (0,1)` such
that `4C_H omega(q)+8Kq<j_0/2` for all `0<q<r_0`; such a radius exists
because the displayed expression tends to zero. Then the relative open set

\[
 \mathcal U=\{\mu\in\mathcal P(\mathcal Z):
                  \mathcal W_1(\mu,\mu_0)<r_0\}          \tag{15}
\]

satisfies, at the specified time `t_0`,

\[
 J_\ell(\mu,t_0)\ge j_0/2,
 \qquad A_\ell(\mu,t_0)\ge\sqrt{j_0/2}>0,
 \quad\mu\in\mathcal U,\quad\ell=1,2.                  \tag{16}
\]

The same construction works at any chosen reference time in `(0,tau]`,
with its own neighborhood and positive margin. For example, spreading each
reference atom over a sufficiently short input arc and a sufficiently short
label interval preserves membership in (15), so the open family contains
nonatomic laws. Moving the second reference input through a sufficiently
small nonzero angle gives correlated two-input laws in (15).

## 5. Transfer to actual finite networks

For a finite network trained on an empirical law `lambda_n`, with its actual
random initial readout, define

\[
 J_{n,\eta,\ell}(t)=\int_{\mathcal Z}\frac1n
 \|h_{n,\eta,\lambda_n}^{(\ell)}(t,x)
       -h_{n,\lambda_n}^{(\ell)}(0,x)\|_2^2\,\lambda_n(dx,dy).
                                                               \tag{17}
\]

For `lambda_n->mu` in `W_1`, the fixed-reference comparison and
finite-program identification must retain the paired initial/current
activation observations. Their required conclusion is

\[
 \sup_{t\le T_*}|J_{n,\eta_n,\ell}(t)-J_\ell(\mu,t)|
       \longrightarrow0\quad\hbox{in probability},       \tag{18}
\]

as `n->infinity` and `eta_n->0`, with no restriction between these sequences
and the sample counts. This is stronger than scalar predictor convergence;
(18) is not inferred from predictor convergence. It follows from the same
state comparison as follows. Against a fixed finite reference proxy, a
state error `e` changes each recomputed activation RMS by at most `Ce`
uniformly in `x`, so changes (17) by at most `Ce`. On the bounded-state
event, (2) has the identical finite RMS form. It permits transport of the
averaging law with error `8K W_1` and reduction of the remaining reference
input integral to a fixed finite input net. At that fixed net, paired
initial/current proxy activations form a fixed finite program, whose
quadratic displacement observations converge. Its finite time mesh is
fixed during width identification; bounded state interpolation speeds and
the activation Lipschitz bound control the intervals between its time
points. Remove the proxy state error, transport error, input net and proof
mesh in the ordered limits used by the joint-algorithm theorem. This yields
(18), without a distance between finite matrices and population operators.

For iid empirical laws independent of initialization, use the corresponding
in-probability joint-limit statement with these same observations. In
particular, for every `mu in U` and either deterministic empirical
approximation or iid sampling, (16), (18) imply

\[
 \Pr\{J_{n,\eta_n,\ell}(t_0)\ge j_0/4
                 \text{ for both }\ell=1,2\}\longrightarrow1. \tag{19}
\]

Thus both hidden activation displacements stay bounded away from zero as
width increases, at a physical time and activity margin independent of
width, sample count and GD step. The finite initialization is the one in
the question: its readout RMS has squared expectation `1/n^2`, hence tends
to zero in probability and is covered by the initialization-perturbation
comparison. It has not been set to zero in (17).

This result asserts finite-time motion of both hidden representations on an
open family. It asserts no activity for every law, no fitting, no risk
improvement, no endpoint selection and no global-time property. In
particular a law with zero conditional label mean can have the stationary
zero-readout population solution, consistently with the stated scope.

## Proof dependencies and checks

Read for this derivation: `docs/global_nonlinear.md` C.1, C.2, C.3 in full,
including weighted-loss corrections; A.1–A.2; the complete III.F in
`docs/special_data_limits.md`; `docs/finite_dynamics.md` §§1–4; the notation
and research guides. The reference satisfies C.1's bounded-derivative tanh
hypotheses, independent Gaussian initialization, fixed dimension/data and
positive weights. C.3 is the source of the onset architecture, while (6)–(10)
above supply all needed activity details directly. No specialized external
theorem or computational experiment is a dependency.

Author: `/root/nonlazy`. Author check: derived every coefficient from the
weighted equations (5), checked the factor `p=omega y`, retained actual
adjunction in (7), (9), checked activation rather than parameter displacement,
and exposed the state/observable dependencies (12), (18). The decisive
population construction and transport estimates remain the responsibility
of the other proof components; this file does not label them assumptions
to declare the full study resolved. Fresh isolated package reviews remain
required.
