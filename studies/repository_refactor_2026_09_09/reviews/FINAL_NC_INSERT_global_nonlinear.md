## Nonlinear activation, separation, and continuation additions

These fragments extend the global nonlinear and special-data chapters. Each probability statement takes width to infinity at a fixed depth, fixed finite dataset, fixed activation, and fixed finite physical horizon. Constants uniform over a parameter class do not assert a probability supremum over that class. Layer populations are separate. Initialized actions and their adjoints are constructed jointly; only trained increments are Hilbert--Schmidt.

The packages are: a global two-hidden-layer activation transform and its affine-first arbitrary-data exception; a local fixed-depth C1,1 theorem and its Gaussian strict-activity corollary; separated two-sample offset, odd, and general-shape theorems; all-fixed-depth odd perturbations; the three-sample odd-gain theorem; and exact moderate-amplitude identities, local limits, finite-algorithm estimates, strong endpoints, and conditional continuation.

The finite Gaussian construction, including rank loss, causal bounded-derivative scalar feedback, common generated spaces, and adjunction, is the contained proof in **special-data Section III.F**. The observation and same-width comparison arguments are **Section III.V**. They are mathematical dependencies within the library. Their coordinate hypotheses are verified below; neither theorem is applied directly to an instruction with unbounded derivative. Equation numbers inside each numbered fragment are local to that fragment.

For the two-sample and odd-gain fragments using first-coordinate notation \(V^1\) or \(w\), the exact conversion to the notation contract is
\[
 V^1=W^{(1)}/\sqrt d,\qquad z_a^1=V^1x_a,
 \qquad \frac d n\|dV^1\|_F^2=\frac1n\|dW^{(1)}\|_F^2.
\]
A displayed first matrix with entry variance \(1/d\), including a locally named \(W^1\), always means this \(V^1\). For finite vectors, any rank-one symbol u tensor v or \(u\otimes v\) means the matrix uv^T/n; its population counterpart is the rank-one action q -> u E[vq]. The stored readout is \(C=W^{(L+1)}\), and \(f_a=C^Th_a^L/n\). The half-sum loss in those fragments is explicitly \(\frac12\sum_a(f_a-y_a)^2\); its raw mobilities in canonical coordinates are \((n,1,\ldots,1,n)\). The broad two-layer theorem instead uses the unhalved sum, and the general local theorem uses its stated weighted mean. Their factors of two are retained. An auxiliary feature time or normalized time is never the raw GD step.

There are 46 proof units after the common lemmas. They are organized as follows.

| Fragments | Result | Destination and exact scope |
|---|---|---|
| A, B | Continuous-value Gaussian specialization; activation transform; affine-first exception | Global nonlinear: L=2, bounded top activation/readout, orthogonal data; arbitrary fixed input geometry for an affine first activation. Exact raw GD uses eta_n sqrt(n)->0, or eta_n->0 in the affine exception. |
| C | Local C1,1 limit, finite-GF corollary, strict Gaussian activity | Global nonlinear: fixed L,m,d, subGaussian first/readout roots and arbitrary fixed data on one positive interval; activity has its additional stated Gaussian/nondegeneracy assumptions. |
| D | Offset separation theorem | Special data: L=3,m=2, rho in [-1,1-delta], binary labels, a delta-selected coefficient, full compact-physical-time GF/GD bundle. |
| E | Odd perturbations at e<=c_poly delta^2 | Special data: L=3,m=2, two-sided separation, all binary labels; convex and unit-Gaussian-energy variants. |
| F | General nonodd/linear-growth shapes and affine positivity | Special data: L=3,m=2, e<=c_dyn delta^(31/8); a further shape cutoff gives persistent nonaffinity. Affine positivity is an exact separate lemma. |
| G | Odd perturbations at all fixed depths | Special data: each fixed L>=4; explicit depth-dependent coefficient/exponent, full GF/GD and motion bundle. |
| H | One odd large-gain activation for all fixed depths | Special data: m=3, fixed L>=2, two-sided separation and binary labels; gain depends on separation, not depth. |
| I | Moderate sine initialization/local limit/finite algorithms/endpoints/conditional global construction | Exact calibrated coefficient 2/5; no unconditional global population theorem is asserted. |
| J | Bounded learned memories and simultaneous-coordinate obstruction | Exact identities or conditional necessary inequalities at their displayed model scopes. |

The term “full bundle” in this table means the explicitly stated same-layer path and field/velocity Wasserstein-2 laws, finite collections of times, all true kernel blocks, fixed generated actions/adjoints, predictions, loss, second moments and integrated squared speeds. It excludes cross-layer neuron pairing, cross-width operator-norm convergence, a growing query language and an infinite-time/width interchange. B and C retain their own narrower observable statements.

Fragments A–C are below. Fragments D–J are in the
[special-data chapter](special_data_limits.md), under “Further correlated-data
nonlinear families”. The references to III.F and III.V mean the complete
proofs in that chapter.

## A. Contained probability and continuity specializations

### A.1. Continuous, at-most-linear value instructions

**Lemma.** Extend the finite-program value conclusion of Section III.F to a fixed finite program whose coordinate maps are continuous and satisfy \(|F(x)|\le C(1+|x|)\). Roots are iid finite-second-moment tuples, independent of the initialized Gaussian matrices. Every fixed same-layer tuple converges in probability in \(\mathcal W_2\). The action interpretation is the continuous extension of the actions already constructed in Section III.F. This assertion gives values and second moments, without asserting a formal-derivative formula for these extra instructions.

**Proof.** If \(X_j\to X\) in \(L^2\), continuity and the linear envelope imply \(F(X_j)\to F(X)\) in \(L^2\). Indeed \(|X_j|^2\) is uniformly integrable; uniform continuity on compact balls gives convergence in probability, and the linear envelope supplies uniform integrability of the squared outputs. The same argument proves continuity of pushforward in \(\mathcal W_2\).

Choose smooth compactly supported \(F_R\) converging locally uniformly to \(F\), with a common envelope \(C'(1+|x|)\). Such maps follow by a cutoff on the radius-\(2R\) ball, mollification, and increasing \(R\); each has a finite bounded first derivative. At a fixed limiting input \(X\), \(\|F_R(X)-F(X)\|_2\to0\). Once a prefix has its joint \(\mathcal W_2\) law, its empirical squared approximation error also converges, because \(|F_R-F|^2\) is continuous with at most quadratic growth.

Induct through the finite instructions. Coordinate instructions pass by the pushforward argument. For a matrix instruction, approximate its entire already constructed input prefix by bounded-derivative programs. At finite width the output RMS error is at most the initialized operator bound times the input RMS error; the identical bound holds on the generated population spaces. Thus the matrix outputs are Cauchy in the required law and agree with the extended action. To construct prefix approximants, first choose the current smooth map to achieve its desired limiting error, and only then choose the preceding-prefix tolerance smaller than that error divided by the smooth map's Lipschitz constant. This order avoids any assumption that cutoff Lipschitz constants are uniform. Finite unions of the approximant programs give joint laws, so the induction retains all desired same-layer tuples and both orientations. Let width tend to infinity at each fixed approximant and then remove its approximation. The finite number of instructions completes the proof. \(\square\)

For the activation flow \(J(s,z)\) below, \(|J(s,z)|\le|z|+M|s|\) and joint continuity are sufficient for this lemma. Its possible \(\exp(L|s|)\) sensitivity to the frozen root is not assumed bounded. No response derivative of \(J\) is used. Feedback in that application is transferred separately by the same-root clock stability estimate proved in the two-layer fragment.

### A.2. Fixed neural programs with unbounded backward products

For a **fixed** program with subGaussian root marginals, C2 activations with bounded first and second derivatives, and products \(b(z)q\) with bounded C1 \(b,b'\), the values in A.1 also have the ordinary named-source response formulas obtained by truncating each such product. This is a fixed-program specialization, not an all-moment theorem for arbitrary scalar-feedback programs.

Here are the derivative details. Freeze deterministic coefficients and covariance parameters. Replace each product by \(b(z)\tau_R(q)\), where \(|\tau_R(q)|\le|q|\), \(|\tau_R'|\le1\), and the clip equals the identity on larger and larger compact intervals. At fixed \(R\), every coordinate instruction meets Section III.F's bounded-derivative hypotheses. In the finite scalar recursion, every value has a linear envelope in the finite root/source list, uniformly in the clips while earlier coefficients stay in a compact set. Each first named-source derivative has a polynomial envelope in that list: the only extra factor introduced by differentiating a product is \(|q|\), and there are only finitely many instructions. The clip derivative is bounded by one.

Proceed chronologically in this scalar recursion. Second moments of earlier inputs converge; hence the next finite covariance matrix converges. Couple its Gaussian sources by their positive-semidefinite square roots. The square roots converge even at rank loss, as proved in Section III.F. On this coupling the roots have all moments, and the Gaussian sources have uniformly bounded moments of every fixed order. Local C1 convergence of the clipped expressions and the polynomial derivative envelopes imply convergence in probability and uniform integrability of their first derivatives. Their expectations therefore converge. This identifies the next response coefficient, keeps it bounded, and closes the finite induction. Values agree with A.1 by its same-array RMS approximation and bounded actions. Roots are never differentiated; arbitrary subGaussian iid root tuples are admitted directly as roots. This proves the stated derivative specialization without a quantile-map differentiation or a claim about empirical higher moments.

Locally Lipschitz scalar contractions can be replaced causally by their deterministic limiting values. In the local theorem below their actual finite feedback is recovered by the separately proved one-reference tail comparison. In capped training programs Section III.F already proves this feedback passage directly. No assertion concerning an increasing transcript is needed.

### A.3. Sharp initialized action constant with a contained proof

For an \(n\times n\) matrix \(G\) of independent standard Gaussians,
\[
 E\|G\|_{op}\le2\sqrt n,\qquad
 \Pr\{\|G/\sqrt n\|_{op}>2+\varepsilon\}
 \le (\varepsilon^2n)^{-1}.
\]
Thus every fixed collection of finite initialized actions has norm at most three with probability tending to one, and their canonical generated actions have norm at most two. This supplies the constants used in the odd-gain and fixed-depth affine arguments.

For completeness, compare Gaussian processes \(X_{u,v}=u^TGv\) and \(Y_{u,v}=g^Tu+h^Tv\) on pairs of unit vectors. If \(\alpha=u^Tu'\), \(\beta=v^Tv'\), their increment-variance difference is \(2(1-\alpha)(1-\beta)\ge0\). On a finite net, the Gaussian comparison follows by interpolating the independent processes in \(E[b^{-1}\log\sum_i\exp(bZ_i)]\). Gaussian integration by parts makes the derivative equal to
\(\frac b4 E\sum_{i,j}p_ip_j(d_Y(i,j)^2-d_X(i,j)^2)\ge0\), where the \(p_i\) are softmax weights. Let \(b\to\infty\), then increase the finite nets. Continuity and integrability give \(E\sup X\le E\sup Y=E\|g\|+E\|h\|\le2\sqrt n\).

The Gaussian Poincare inequality needed for the probability bound also has a short proof. For smooth bounded \(f\), let \(P_tf(x)=E f(e^{-t}x+\sqrt{1-e^{-2t}}Z)\). Integration by parts against the Gaussian density gives
\[
 -\frac d{dt}E(P_tf)^2=2E|\nabla P_tf|^2,
 \qquad \nabla P_tf=e^{-t}P_t\nabla f.
\]
Integrate from zero to infinity and apply Jensen and Gaussian invariance to obtain \(\operatorname{Var}f\le E|\nabla f|^2\). Smooth cutoff approximations extend it to Lipschitz \(f\). The spectral norm is one-Lipschitz in the Frobenius coordinates, so \(\operatorname{Var}\|G\|_{op}\le1\); Chebyshev proves the displayed bound. Finite norm inequalities pass to each generated input, then to their countable dense span. Taking rational \(\varepsilon\downarrow0\) gives the canonical constant two. No exponential matrix-concentration theorem is imported.

### A.4. Scalar gradient and strong-chain rules

For bounded continuous \(b\), if \(Z_j\to Z\), \(Q_j\to Q\) in \(L^2\), then
\[
 \|b(Z_j)Q_j-b(Z)Q\|_2\to0.
\]
Subtract the varying \(Q\) first; for the other term truncate the fixed \(Q\) and use bounded convergence. The same proof is uniform over a compact \(L^2\) family using a finite net. Hence bounded activation derivatives give the strong chain rule along C1 \(L^2\) curves, and bounded actions with Hilbert--Schmidt derivatives obey \((WH)'=W'H+WH'\). This does not assert Frechet differentiability of a nonlinear activation map on the whole \(L^2\) space.

For a scalar prediction, Frechet differentiability in the raw Hilbert metric does hold under the bounded-derivative hypotheses used below. For a fixed reverse factor \(q\), the scalar Taylor remainder is bounded by
\[
 \tfrac12 L M\|h\|_2^2+2D\|q\mathbf1_{|q|>M}\|_2\|h\|_2.
\]
Here \(D\) bounds the derivative and \(L\) its Lipschitz constant. First take \(\|h\|_2\downarrow0\), then \(M\to\infty\). Expand the finite number of action/activation products and use \(\|\Delta W\|_{op}\le\|\Delta W\|_{HS}\). This proves the true scalar derivative, its backward-adjoint formula, and continuity of that gradient. Every energy identity below consequently belongs to the specified raw metric.


## B. Global two-layer limits beyond one activation

The theorem below uses the unhalved sum loss and the displayed positive block constants. Orthogonal input projections are essential to its nonlinear first-layer coordinate proof. Its affine-first corollary admits every fixed Gram matrix, including singular matrices. Width identification uses the value lemma A.1; no formal sensitivity formula for the activation transform is invoked.

### B.1. Global two-hidden-layer activation transform

Within this proof unit, unqualified section and equation numbers are local.

#### The theorem and the network

Fix \(m<\infty\) inputs \(x_a\in\mathbb R^d\) satisfying
\[
\frac{x_a^\top x_b}{d}=\mathbf 1_{\{a=b\}},
\qquad 1\le a,b\le m.
\]
Fix labels \(y_a\in\mathbb R\) and positive constants \(\kappa_1,\kappa_2,\kappa_3\), independent of width and step size. Allow different activations in the two hidden layers:

- \(\phi^{(1)}\) is continuously differentiable, and \((\phi^{(1)})'\) is bounded and globally Lipschitz. The activation itself need not be bounded, monotone, or odd.
- \(\phi^{(2)}\) is bounded and continuously differentiable, and \((\phi^{(2)})'\) is bounded and globally Lipschitz.

The dimensions are \(W^{(1)}\in\mathbb R^{n\times d}\), \(W^{(2)}\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}\), and \(W^{(3)}\in\mathbb R^n\). The readout \(W^{(3)}\) is the rescaled readout throughout. Define
\[
\begin{aligned}
z_a^{(1)}&=\frac{W^{(1)}x_a}{\sqrt d},
&
h_a^{(1)}&=\phi^{(1)}(z_a^{(1)}),\\
z_a^{(2)}&=W^{(2)}h_a^{(1)},
&
h_a^{(2)}&=\phi^{(2)}(z_a^{(2)}),\\
f_{n,a}&=\frac{(W^{(3)})^\top h_a^{(2)}}{n},
&
r_{n,a}&=f_{n,a}-y_a,
\qquad L_n=\sum_{a=1}^m r_{n,a}^2.
\end{aligned}
\]
The residual-free backpropagated derivatives are
\[
\delta_a^{(2)}
=
W^{(3)}\odot(\phi^{(2)})'(z_a^{(2)}),
\qquad
\delta_a^{(1)}
=
(\phi^{(1)})'(z_a^{(1)})
\odot(W^{(2)})^\top\delta_a^{(2)}.
\]
Thus \(\delta_a^{(\ell)}=n\,\partial f_{n,a}/\partial z_a^{(\ell)}\). The exact updates are
\[
\begin{aligned}
z_{a,k+1}^{(1)}
&=
z_{a,k}^{(1)}
-2\kappa_1\eta_n r_{n,a,k}\delta_{a,k}^{(1)},\\
W_{k+1}^{(2)}
&=
W_k^{(2)}
-\frac{2\kappa_2\eta_n}{n}
\sum_{a=1}^m
r_{n,a,k}\delta_{a,k}^{(2)}(h_{a,k}^{(1)})^\top,\\
W_{k+1}^{(3)}
&=
W_k^{(3)}
-2\kappa_3\eta_n
\sum_{a=1}^m r_{n,a,k}h_{a,k}^{(2)}.
\end{aligned} \tag{1}
\]
The first equation uses orthogonality. In the original first weights, it follows from
\[
W_{k+1}^{(1)}
=
W_k^{(1)}
-\frac{2\kappa_1\eta_n}{\sqrt d}
\sum_{a=1}^m r_{n,a,k}\delta_{a,k}^{(1)}x_a^\top.
\]

Initialize independently by
\[
W_{0,ij}^{(1)}\sim N(0,\sigma_1^2),
\qquad
W_{0,ji}^{(2)}\sim N(0,\sigma_2^2/n),
\]
where the variances are fixed and finite. The following readout initializations are allowed:

- A vanishing Gaussian readout
  \[
  W_{0,j}^{(3)}\sim N(0,\sigma_3^2n^{-2\beta}),
  \qquad \beta>0.
  \]
  Here \(\beta\) describes the decay of the standard deviation. Gaussian tail bounds give
  \[
  \|W_0^{(3)}\|_\infty
  =
  O_{\mathbb P}(n^{-\beta}\sqrt{\log n})
  \longrightarrow0.
  \]
  The original initialization has \(\beta=1\).
- More generally, an independent readout whose coordinate supremum tends to zero in probability. Its population initialization is zero.
- A fixed bounded readout law: the coordinates are iid with a law supported on \([-B_0,B_0]\), independently of the other initialization. The population starts from that law. A perturbation whose coordinate supremum tends to zero may also be added, giving a finite initial supremum at most \(B_0+o_{\mathbb P}(1)\).

An arbitrary bounded iid law is admitted directly as a root tuple in A.1. The bounded nonvanishing option does **not** include an untruncated \(O(1)\) Gaussian readout: that initialization lacks the population supremum bound used in this proof.

For every fixed \(T<\infty\), the population equations have a unique autonomous gradient-flow solution on \([0,T]\). For every sequence
\[
\eta_n>0,
\qquad
\eta_n\sqrt n\longrightarrow0,
\]
the exact GD trajectories on the clock \(t=k\eta_n\) converge to that solution. Interpolate the finite parameters linearly and recompute the forward pass between steps.

The conclusion includes predictions, summed loss, all kernel-block entries, same-layer joint hidden path laws with their second moments, and fixed finite collections of continuous globally Lipschitz forward/adjoint measurements. Products in these measurement constructions must have bounded varying factors; the unbounded backward fields and their quadratic measurements are included through the tail argument below. Integrated squared hidden speeds converge as well. Convergence is in probability, uniformly in time for the stated pointwise measurements. No claim about arbitrary higher-growth measurements is needed.

The step condition is sufficient, not claimed necessary. These activation assumptions alone do not force nonlinearity or motion: they intentionally include a constant or affine first activation. Additional assumptions for strict feature learning appear at the end.

#### A scalar coordinate that removes the first-layer gate

Let \(J(s,z)\) solve
\[
\frac{\partial J(s,z)}{\partial s}
=
(\phi^{(1)})'(J(s,z)),
\qquad
J(0,z)=z,
\qquad s\in\mathbb R.
\tag{2}
\]
Write
\[
M_1=\|(\phi^{(1)})'\|_\infty,
\qquad
L_1=\operatorname{Lip}((\phi^{(1)})').
\]
The bounded Lipschitz scalar vector field has a unique global solution in both time directions. Integration and the scalar difference inequality give
\[
|J(s,z)-J(t,z)|\le M_1|s-t|,
\qquad
|J(s,z)|\le |z|+M_1|s|,
\tag{3}
\]
\[
|J(s,z)-J(s,w)|
\le e^{L_1|s|}|z-w|.
\]
In particular, \(J\) is jointly continuous. Uniqueness gives the flow identity
\[
J(s,J(t,z))=J(s+t,z),
\]
because both sides solve the same scalar equation as functions of \(s\), with the same value at \(s=0\). Also,
\[
|\phi^{(1)}(J(s,z))-\phi^{(1)}(J(t,z))|
\le M_1^2|s-t|. \tag{4}
\]

For each input introduce a clock displacement \(X_a^{(1)}(0)=0\), keeping the fixed Gaussian root \(Z_{0,a}^{(1)}\), and set
\[
Z_a^{(1)}(t)
=
J(X_a^{(1)}(t),Z_{0,a}^{(1)}).
\tag{5}
\]
The population network is
\[
\begin{aligned}
H_a^{(1)}&=\phi^{(1)}(Z_a^{(1)}),
&
Z_a^{(2)}&=W^{(2)}H_a^{(1)},\\
H_a^{(2)}&=\phi^{(2)}(Z_a^{(2)}),
&
f_a&=\mathbb E[W^{(3)}H_a^{(2)}],
\qquad r_a=f_a-y_a,\\
\delta_a^{(2)}
&=
W^{(3)}(\phi^{(2)})'(Z_a^{(2)}),
&
\delta_a^{(1)}
&=
(\phi^{(1)})'(Z_a^{(1)})
(W^{(2)})^*\delta_a^{(2)}.
\end{aligned}
\]
Its transformed equations are
\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot X_a^{(1)}
&=-2\kappa_1 r_a(W^{(2)})^*\delta_a^{(2)},\\
\dot W^{(2)}
&=-2\kappa_2\sum_{a=1}^m
r_a\delta_a^{(2)}\otimes H_a^{(1)},\\
\dot W^{(3)}
&=-2\kappa_3\sum_{a=1}^m r_aH_a^{(2)}.
\end{aligned} \tag{6}
\]
Here the rank-one action is explicitly
\[
(u\otimes v)V=u\,\mathbb E[vV].
\]
Every expectation pairs coordinates of the same layer. The first-layer and second-layer populations are separate.

The initial \(W_0^{(2)}\) is the bounded forward-and-adjoint action obtained from the joint limits of finite Gaussian matrix calculations, as described below. It is **not** an ordinary continuum matrix or integral kernel with iid Gaussian entries. The notation records its action on generated population fields, together with its adjoint.

The scalar chain rule converts (6) into the ordinary first-layer equation
\[
\dot Z_a^{(1)}=-2\kappa_1 r_a\delta_a^{(1)}.
\tag{7}
\]
Conversely, any solution of (7) in the bounded state class used below has representation (5). Indeed, Cauchy–Schwarz and Fubini make its backward coefficient integrable in time at almost every coordinate. For an integrable scalar coefficient \(b(t)\), the equation
\[
\dot z(t)=b(t)(\phi^{(1)})'(z(t))
\]
has the solution
\[
z(t)=J\!\left(\int_0^t b(s)\,ds,z(0)\right).
\]
Differentiation verifies the equation, and the Lipschitz difference inequality with integrable coefficient \(|b(t)|L_1\) proves uniqueness. Thus the scalar coordinate changes neither the original gradient flow nor its possible solutions.

When \((\phi^{(1)})'>0\), one can use
\[
F'(z)=\frac1{(\phi^{(1)})'(z)},
\qquad
J(s,z)=F^{-1}(F(z)+s).
\]
But the displacement formulation does not require
\(\mathbb E[F(Z_0^{(1)})^2]<\infty\). The rapid growth of this integral for an erf activation therefore places no restriction on its Gaussian initialization variance.

#### Global existence, uniqueness, and autonomy

For a population variable \(U\), write
\[
\|U\|_{L^2}:=\sqrt{\mathbb E[U^2]}.
\]
The operator norm is its largest amplification of this root-mean-square size. Compare two states with the same fixed first-layer roots using
\[
\begin{aligned}
d={}&
\sum_{a=1}^m
\|X_a^{(1)}-\widetilde X_a^{(1)}\|_{L^2}\\
&+\|W^{(2)}-\widetilde W^{(2)}\|_{\mathrm{op}}
+\|W^{(3)}-\widetilde W^{(3)}\|_{L^2}.
\end{aligned} \tag{8}
\]
At finite width replace every population \(L^2\) norm by the ordinary Euclidean norm divided by \(\sqrt n\); denote this distance by \(d_n\).

On sets with bounded clock \(L^2\) norms, matrix operator norms, and readout suprema, the transformed vector field is Lipschitz in (8), with a constant independent of width. The key bounds are as follows. Equation (4) controls first-activation differences, and
\[
\|H_a^{(1)}\|_{L^2}
\le
|\phi^{(1)}(0)|
+M_1\|Z_{0,a}^{(1)}\|_{L^2}
+M_1^2\|X_a^{(1)}\|_{L^2}.
\tag{9}
\]
Adding and subtracting one factor bounds the forward matrix difference. The second-layer backward difference satisfies
\[
\begin{aligned}
\|\delta_a^{(2)}-\widetilde\delta_a^{(2)}\|_{L^2}
\le{}&
\|(\phi^{(2)})'\|_\infty
\|W^{(3)}-\widetilde W^{(3)}\|_{L^2}\\
&+
\|\widetilde W^{(3)}\|_\infty
\operatorname{Lip}((\phi^{(2)})')
\|Z_a^{(2)}-\widetilde Z_a^{(2)}\|_{L^2}.
\end{aligned}
\tag{10}
\]
Its adjoint response is Lipschitz by the operator bound. The output uses boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of \(\phi^{(2)}\). Finally,
\[
\|u\otimes v-\widetilde u\otimes\widetilde v\|_{\mathrm{op}}
\le
\|u-\widetilde u\|_{L^2}\|v\|_{L^2}
+
\|\widetilde u\|_{L^2}\|v-\widetilde v\|_{L^2}.
\]
These estimates prove local existence and uniqueness by contracting the integrated equations on a short interval. A common readout supremum bound defines a closed complete set under (8), and its integral update preserves that bound after the interval is made short enough.

The chain rule and the adjoint identity give
\[
\dot f=-2Kr,
\qquad
\dot L=-4r^\top Kr\le0,
\tag{11}
\]
where
\[
K=\kappa_1K^{(1)}+\kappa_2K^{(2)}+\kappa_3K^{(3)}
\]
and
\[
\begin{aligned}
K_{ab}^{(1)}
&=\mathbf1_{\{a=b\}}\,
\mathbb E[\delta_a^{(1)}\delta_b^{(1)}],\\
K_{ab}^{(2)}
&=\mathbb E[H_a^{(1)}H_b^{(1)}]\,
  \mathbb E[\delta_a^{(2)}\delta_b^{(2)}],\\
K_{ab}^{(3)}
&=\mathbb E[H_a^{(2)}H_b^{(2)}].
\end{aligned}
\tag{12}
\]
Each block is the Gram matrix of the corresponding parameter gradients. Thus \(\|r(t)\|_2\le\|r(0)\|_2\).

Let \(B_2=\|\phi^{(2)}\|_\infty\). The readout equation yields
\[
\|W^{(3)}(t)\|_\infty
\le
\|W^{(3)}(0)\|_\infty
+
2\kappa_3B_2\sqrt m\,\|r(0)\|_2t.
\tag{13}
\]
On any prescribed finite horizon \(T\), this bounds every \(\delta_a^{(2)}\), both in mean square and in supremum. Equations (6) and (9) then give
\[
\|\dot X_a^{(1)}\|_{L^2}
\le C_T\|W^{(2)}\|_{\mathrm{op}},
\qquad
\|\dot W^{(2)}\|_{\mathrm{op}}
\le C_T\left(1+\sum_a\|X_a^{(1)}\|_{L^2}\right).
\tag{14}
\]
The fixed initial root norms are absorbed into \(C_T\). Adding and integrating these inequalities gives a linear Gronwall bound on the clock norms and matrix operator norm throughout \([0,T]\). No finite-time blow-up or loss of the bounded-state conditions is possible. The solution therefore extends uniquely to every finite horizon.

The original state is autonomous as well. At a restart time, take the current \(Z_a^{(1)}\) as the new roots in (5), set the new clocks to zero, and repeat the same argument. The original equations require only current fields and the current matrix action and adjoint. More formally, the closed spaces generated from current fields by the bounded coordinate operations and these actions contain the future integral construction. Equal current joint action laws give an isometry of these spaces that preserves the equations. Uniqueness then gives equal future action laws. Earlier clock values and the original initialization are not additional information needed for the future.

###### Identifying the population action and passing to the width limit

Use A.1 for the fixed finite value programs, jointly for both matrix orientations. The transform is continuous with at most linear growth in (clock, root). Its exponential root sensitivity is not a bounded-derivative hypothesis and no response derivative of that transform is taken. Empirical residual/contraction feedback is identified by the same-root oracle comparison below.

For clarity, the common initial action is constructed before solving the flow. Collect the finite calculations for rational meshes, their finite unions, and a countable closure under the coordinate operations and bounded continuous measurements used here. The fixed-program theorem gives consistent finite joint laws, realized on one coordinate space for each layer. Exact finite linear identities pass to these laws. A Gaussian matrix operator bound implies, with a fixed sufficiently large \(M\),
\[
\|W_0^{(2)}V\|_{L^2}
\le M\|V\|_{L^2}
\]
for every generated \(V\); the same holds for the transpose action. For example the finite bound follows from two \(1/4\)-nets and a union bound,
\[
\mathbb P\!\left(\|W_0^{(2)}\|_{\mathrm{op}}>M\right)
\le
2\,9^{2n}
\exp\!\left(-\frac{nM^2}{8\sigma_2^2}\right)
\longrightarrow0
\]
when \(\sigma_2>0\); the action is zero when \(\sigma_2=0\).
Hence the actions are well-defined on variables equal in mean square and extend to the closures of the generated spans. The finite transpose identity passes to
\[
\mathbb E[U\,W_0^{(2)}V]
=
\mathbb E[((W_0^{(2)})^*U)V].
\tag{15}
\]
This identifies the forward and backward actions as adjoints on the same two fixed spaces. It is the initial object used in (6).

For a proof mesh \(\Delta\), Euler applied to (6) has error \(O_T(\Delta)\), uniformly in width and also in the population space. The bounded vector field and its Lipschitz constant give a one-step error \(C_T\Delta^2\), so
\[
e_{k+1}\le(1+C_T\Delta)e_k+C_T\Delta^2.
\]
Summation gives the stated error. A first-exit argument keeps the clock and matrix inside slightly larger bounds; the readout supremum is controlled separately by its update, as in (13).

At fixed \(\Delta\), expand the trained matrix as its initialization plus finitely many rank-one updates. Construct the oracle using the population residuals and every population contraction in those expansions. The fixed-program theorem identifies all its joint node laws and quadratic contractions. Applying its proxy matrix to an oracle vector differs from the prescribed node by finitely many terms of the form
\[
-2\kappa_2\Delta r_{b,s}\,
\delta_{b,s,\mathrm{oracle}}^{(2)}
\left[
\frac{
(h_{b,s,\mathrm{oracle}}^{(1)})^\top
h_{a,k,\mathrm{oracle}}^{(1)}
}{n}
-
\mathbb E[H_{b,s}^{(1)}H_{a,k}^{(1)}]
\right].
\tag{16}
\]
Each scalar discrepancy vanishes and each vector has bounded root-mean-square norm. The corresponding transpose discrepancies use contractions of two second-layer backward fields. Thus recomputed proxy quantities approach the oracle nodes.

The state estimate (8) transfers this identification to finite Euler with empirical feedback. All factors involving the readout can be clipped beyond its proven supremum bound without changing any oracle value. For comparisons the roots stay fixed: \(J\) and its first activation are uniformly Lipschitz in their changing clock arguments. A joint global Lipschitz bound in the frozen root is neither asserted nor needed.

Consequently, taking \(n\to\infty\) at fixed \(\Delta\), and then \(\Delta\to0\), proves the population limit of the finite continuous flow on every \([0,T]\).

#### The bridge from exact GD

A scalar estimate makes the discrete argument work even when the first derivative vanishes or changes sign. In the following calculation only, write
\[
A=(\phi^{(1)})',
\qquad L=\operatorname{Lip}(A),
\qquad
z^+=z+\eta A(z)b.
\]
If \(L\eta|b|\le1/2\) and \(A(z)\ne0\), then for \(0\le s\le1\),
\[
|A(z+s\eta A(z)b)-A(z)|
\le L\eta|A(z)b|
\le \frac{|A(z)|}{2}.
\]
The whole segment stays in the same interval where \(A\ne0\). Define its exact scalar-flow clock increment by
\[
\Delta X=\int_z^{z^+}\frac{du}{A(u)}.
\]
Then \(z^+=J(\Delta X,z)\). Substitution in the integral gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
|\Delta X-\eta b|
&\le
\eta|b|\int_0^1
\left|
\frac{A(z)}{A(z+s\eta A(z)b)}-1
\right|\,ds\\
&\le L\eta^2b^2.
\end{aligned} \tag{17}
\]
If \(A(z)=0\), the raw step fixes \(z\). Set \(\Delta X=\eta b\); the same exact representation holds because \(J(s,z)=z\) at an equilibrium. If \(L=0\), the derivative is constant and there is no coordinate defect or step restriction.

Apply (17) to each coordinate with
\[
b_a
=
-2\kappa_1r_{n,a}
(W^{(2)})^\top\delta_a^{(2)}.
\tag{18}
\]
The raw GD trajectories themselves have width-independent bounds on \([0,T]\). First,
\[
|r_{n,a}|
\le |y_a|+B_2\|W^{(3)}\|_\infty
\]
and the readout update give a discrete Gronwall bound on its supremum. This bounds \(\delta_a^{(2)}\). The first raw update then has root-mean-square increment at most \(C_T\eta_n\|W^{(2)}\|_{\mathrm{op}}\), while the matrix operator increment is at most
\[
C_T\eta_n
\left(
1+\sum_a\frac{\|z_a^{(1)}\|_2}{\sqrt n}
\right).
\]
Adding these bounds gives a second discrete linear Gronwall estimate. The initial root RMS and matrix operator norm are bounded with probability tending to one, and the allowed readout initializations have the requisite high-probability uniform supremum bound. On these events,
\[
\frac{\|b_a\|_2}{\sqrt n}\le C_T,
\qquad
\|b_a\|_\infty\le C_T\sqrt n.
\tag{19}
\]
Thus \(\eta_n\sqrt n\to0\) enforces the scalar step condition throughout the interval.

Lift the raw iterates recursively by these exact clock increments, starting from \(x_{a,0}^{(1)}=0\). The scalar flow identity ensures
\[
z_{a,k}^{(1)}
=
J(x_{a,k}^{(1)},z_{a,0}^{(1)})
\]
exactly at every step. The lifted first update differs from transformed Euler by at most
\[
\begin{aligned}
L\eta_n^2
\left(\frac1n\sum_i b_{a,i}^4\right)^{1/2}
&\le
L\eta_n^2\|b_a\|_\infty
\frac{\|b_a\|_2}{\sqrt n}\\
&\le C_T\eta_n^2\sqrt n
\end{aligned}
\tag{20}
\]
in root-mean-square norm.

It is important that the clocks themselves stay in the common Lipschitz region, including when \(J\) has equilibria and cannot be inverted. Summing their exact increments gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\|x_{a,k}^{(1)}\|_2}{\sqrt n}
&\le
\sum_{j<k}
\left[
\eta_n\frac{\|b_{a,j}\|_2}{\sqrt n}
+
L\eta_n^2\|b_{a,j}\|_\infty
\frac{\|b_{a,j}\|_2}{\sqrt n}
\right]\\
&\le C_T(1+\eta_n\sqrt n),
\qquad k\eta_n\le T.
\end{aligned}
\tag{21}
\]
Thus the transformed stability constant remains width-independent.

The other parameter updates are already Euler updates for (6). Add their ordinary \(O_T(\eta_n^2)\) local flow error and sum the stable recurrence:
\[
\sup_{t\le T}
d_n\!\left(
\text{lifted GD}(t),\text{finite flow}(t)
\right)
\le
C_T(\eta_n+\eta_n\sqrt n).
\tag{22}
\]
At interpolation times, the scalar flow segment and the linear raw segment differ by the same vanishing bound; the state movement inside one step is \(O_T(\eta_n)\). This proves the raw GD bridge without a moment assumption on an unshifted scalar transform.

Combining (22), the fixed-mesh oracle limit, and the two \(O_T(\Delta)\) mesh errors proves the joint width/step conclusion.

For the remaining quadratic measurements, the backward fields
\[
(W^{(2)}(t))^*\delta_a^{(2)}(t)
\]
form a compact time-indexed family in \(L^2\). Their squared tails therefore vanish uniformly as the clipping threshold grows. Clip before multiplying by \((\phi^{(1)})'(Z_a^{(1)})\), pass the resulting bounded Lipschitz measurements through the proved limit, and remove clipping. Fixed-grid second-moment convergence and state continuity give the corresponding finite empirical tail control. This supplies kernel entries and squared hidden velocities without assuming sub-Gaussian tails.

For completeness, uniform velocity-energy bounds also supply the path-law assertion. For a time grid of spacing \(h\), let \(\pi_h t\) be its preceding grid point. Cauchy–Schwarz on each coordinate gives
\[
\frac1n\sum_i
\sup_{t\le T}
|z_i(t)-z_i(\pi_h t)|^2
\le
h\int_0^T
\frac{\|\dot z(t)\|_2^2}{n}\,dt.
\tag{23}
\]
The population counterpart replaces the empirical average by expectation. The parameter bounds above and the bounded activation derivatives bound these integrals uniformly for each hidden layer. Piecewise-linear reconstruction from the same grid satisfies an analogous estimate with a fixed additional factor. At fixed grid size the joint laws converge with second moments; letting \(h\to0\) gives convergence of the hidden path laws with their second moments in the uniform path norm. The clipped backward-field argument likewise identifies the integrated squared speeds.

#### Examples and the input-geometry boundary

Either layer may use arctan, tanh, logistic sigmoid, erf with fixed nonzero input scaling, softsign \(z/(1+|z|)\), or the smooth saturation \(z/\sqrt{1+z^2}\). Sine and cosine also qualify, despite derivative zeros and sign changes. Softsign is not twice continuously differentiable at zero, but
\[
\frac{d}{dz}\frac{z}{1+|z|}
=
\frac1{(1+|z|)^2}
\]
is continuous, bounded, and globally Lipschitz, which is enough.

In the first layer only, affine functions, softplus, GELU, and SiLU also qualify: their derivatives are bounded and globally Lipschitz although the activations are unbounded. ReLU, leaky ReLU, hard tanh, and derivative-jump activations are not covered by this theorem.

For a general input Gram matrix
\[
G_{ab}=\frac{x_a^\top x_b}{d},
\]
the first-layer equation becomes
\[
\dot Z_a^{(1)}
=
-2\kappa_1\sum_b
G_{ab}r_b
(\phi^{(1)})'(Z_b^{(1)})
(W^{(2)})^*\delta_b^{(2)}.
\tag{24}
\]
With a nonlinear first activation, the right side is not the \(a\)-th activation derivative times one scalar backward coefficient. The scalar-coordinate proof therefore does not give a global-time arbitrary-angle theorem.

There is a verified exception. If
\[
\phi^{(1)}(z)=cz+d_0,
\]
then
\[
\dot Z_a^{(1)}
=
-2\kappa_1c\sum_b
G_{ab}r_b(W^{(2)})^*\delta_b^{(2)}.
\tag{25}
\]
The troublesome multiplication by a varying first-layer derivative has disappeared. In the raw state
\((Z_1^{(1)},\ldots,Z_m^{(1)},W^{(2)},W^{(3)})\),
the vector field is Lipschitz on the same bounded sets. The bounds (13)–(14) hold with raw first-layer norms and constants depending on the fixed \(G\). The fixed-program initialization allows the possibly singular Gaussian covariance \(\sigma_1^2G\). The same oracle and mesh proof therefore gives a global population limit for **any fixed finite normalized input configuration**, including singular Gram matrices.

In this affine case, raw GD is already ordinary Euler for the Lipschitz raw vector field, so the sufficient step condition improves to \(\eta_n\to0\). All the preceding readout restrictions remain. This exception does not give a nonlinear first layer: its best affine-fit error is exactly zero.

## C. A local fixed-depth theorem and strict Gaussian activity

The local theorem permits subGaussian first weights and readout, arbitrary fixed data, zero middle variances and frozen blocks as stated. The separate strict-activity corollary requires Gaussian first weights, positive variances and mobilities, zero population readout, nonzero labels and pairwise nonparallel unit inputs. These are additional hypotheses of that corollary.

For fixed C2 Euler programs, A.1–A.2 prove their value and named-source response formulas. Direct iid subGaussian tuples are roots. No Gaussian quantile representation is needed. The response estimates below are uniform over meshes; this uniformity is proved separately from the fixed-program result. Mollification then gives C1,1 activations.

For squared loss, the theorem for every deterministic vanishing GD mesh also gives finite GF: for each fixed width, smooth finite-dimensional Euler convergence allows a deterministic mesh smaller than 1/n with probability of GF/GD discrepancy exceeding 1/n smaller than 1/n. Apply the every-mesh theorem to this diagonal sequence. The finite squared-loss flow exists globally: at fixed width, energy controls its Euclidean parameter length on every finite interval, even with frozen blocks, and its locally Lipschitz field extends from a finite endpoint. The diagonal yields the same local population GF limit, in exactly the observable topologies C.1 states. For the separate general separable-loss extension, use the preliminary local ball on its high-probability initialization event, with stopping outside that event; no global finite-GF claim follows for a loss unbounded below.

### C.1. Local fixed-depth C1,1 theorem

Within this proof unit, unqualified section and equation numbers are local.

#### Statement and exact finite model

Fix integers d,m and L>=2. There are L hidden layers, each of width n. The m
inputs x_a in R^d are fixed, with ||x_a||_2/sqrt(d)<=X and
G_ab=x_a^top x_b/d. Their Gram matrix may be singular and inputs may coincide.
For squared loss assume |y_a|<=Y. Choose positive weights omega_a with
sum_a omega_a=1 and use

    L_n = sum_a omega_a (f_n,a-y_a)^2,       r_n,a=f_n,a-y_a.

This declares a change from summed loss. For summed loss on m examples, the
same statement applies after multiplying physical time by m.

Each activation phi^(ell):R->R is C^1, with bounded derivative and globally
Lipschitz derivative. Fix common finite bounds

    |phi^(ell)(0)|<=D0,
    |phi^(ell)'(s)|<=D1,
    |phi^(ell)'(s)-phi^(ell)'(t)|<=D2 |s-t|.

The activations themselves need not be bounded. In particular their growth is
at most linear. Nonaffinity is not required for existence.

Concrete examples include arctan, tanh, logistic sigmoid, softplus, exact GELU,
and SiLU, with different choices in different layers. For softplus,
phi'=s and phi''=s(1-s), where s is the logistic sigmoid evaluated at the
argument. For exact GELU phi(t)=t Phi(t),
phi'(t)=Phi(t)+t varphi(t) and phi''(t)=(2-t^2)varphi(t), where Phi and
varphi are the standard normal distribution function and density. For SiLU,
phi(t)=t s(t), phi'(t)=s(t)+t s(t)(1-s(t)) and
phi''(t)=2s(t)(1-s(t))+t s(t)(1-s(t))(1-2s(t)). These derivatives are bounded
because Gaussian and logistic tails dominate the displayed polynomial
factors. The C1,1 class also contains a quadratic smoothing of ReLU: zero for
t<=0, t^2/2 for 0<=t<=1, and t-1/2 for t>=1. Its derivative is bounded and
1-Lipschitz although its second derivative does not exist at both junctions.

For the principal initialization take independent Gaussian first weights
W^(1)_0,ij~N(0,sigma_1^2), independent middle matrices
W^(ell)_0,ji~N(0,sigma_ell^2/n), 2<=ell<=L, and independent readout entries
W^(L+1)_0,j distributed as a fixed random variable with

    sup_(p>=2) (E|W^(L+1)_0,j|^p)^(1/p)/sqrt(p) <= B_out < infinity.

Zero, bounded, and nonvanishing Gaussian readout are all allowed. The first
weights may more generally be iid centered subGaussian variables, with a fixed
subGaussian bound B_in. This extension is justified below; the strict-activity
corollary will use Gaussian first weights. All initialization groups are
independent. Sigma values may be zero in the existence theorem.

Define, with coordinatewise activation,

    z^(1)_a=W^(1)x_a/sqrt(d),       h^(1)_a=phi^(1)(z^(1)_a),
    z^(ell)_a=W^(ell)h^(ell-1)_a,  h^(ell)_a=phi^(ell)(z^(ell)_a), 2<=ell<=L,
    f_n,a=(W^(L+1))^top h^(L)_a/n.

W^(L+1) is always the stored rescaled readout. In particular, for L=2 it is
W^(3), and f_n,a=(W^(3))^top h^(2)_a/n.

The backpropagated fields omit the loss derivative:

    delta^(L)_a=W^(L+1) phi^(L)'(z^(L)_a),
    delta^(ell)_a=phi^(ell)'(z^(ell)_a)
                       [(W^(ell+1))^top delta^(ell+1)_a], ell<L.

Thus delta^(ell)_a=n partial f_n,a/partial z^(ell)_a. Choose fixed finite
kappa_ell>=0. Stored-weight gradient-descent rates are

    eta_n (n kappa_1, kappa_2, ..., kappa_L, n kappa_(L+1)).

The exact updates are

    W^(1)_(k+1)=W^(1)_k
        -(2 eta_n kappa_1/sqrt(d)) sum_b omega_b r_n,b,k delta^(1)_b,k x_b^top,
    z^(1)_a,k+1=z^(1)_a,k
        -2 eta_n kappa_1 sum_b omega_b G_ab r_n,b,k delta^(1)_b,k,
    W^(ell)_(k+1)=W^(ell)_k
        -(2 eta_n kappa_ell/n) sum_b omega_b r_n,b,k
                             delta^(ell)_b,k (h^(ell-1)_b,k)^top, 2<=ell<=L,
    W^(L+1)_(k+1)=W^(L+1)_k
        -2 eta_n kappa_(L+1) sum_b omega_b r_n,b,k h^(L)_b,k.                 (1)

Use physical time t=k eta_n, interpolate these parameters linearly, and
recompute forward quantities between grid points.

There is T_*>0 depending only on L, X, Y, D0,D1,D2, the initialization bounds
and the kappa values, such that for EVERY eta_n>0 tending to zero the following
conclusions hold on [0,T_*]:

1. A unique strong population flow exists in the field/operator state described
   below. It is autonomous and retains each matrix together with its adjoint.
2. Predictions, loss, and all kernel entries converge in probability uniformly
   in time to their population values.
3. Separately for each neuron population, empirical laws of the joint m-input
   hidden paths converge in Wasserstein distance of order two for the uniform
   path norm. This applies to both preactivations and activations.
4. Integrated squared hidden speeds converge. Fixed finite, correctly typed
   forward/adjoint probes assembled from Lipschitz coordinate maps, linear
   combinations, and products of a bounded factor and an L2 field also have
   their joint continuous quadratic-growth measurements converge, provided
   the bounded factors are continuous functions of their arguments.

The constants do not depend on n, eta_n, m, d, or a smallest Gram eigenvalue
when the stated bounds remain fixed. Here m,d and the inputs are nevertheless
fixed in the convergence assertion: no uniform convergence rate for growing
datasets or dimension is claimed. Probe length is fixed; arbitrary products of
two unbounded factors are not part of the probe assertion.

#### Population state, construction, and preliminary norm bounds

There is a separate probability space for coordinates in each hidden layer.
The field Z^(1)_a belongs to the first, W^(L+1) to the last. For 2<=ell<=L,
W^(ell) is a bounded linear map from the mean-square space at layer ell-1 to
the one at layer ell. Its adjoint is denoted (W^(ell))^*. Expectations pair
variables belonging to the same population. Define

    (u tensor v)V = u E[v V].

This is the population version of the finite map u v^top/n. The population
forward and backward formulas are those above with uppercase Z,H, expectation
in place of b^top c/n, and * in place of top. In particular

    f_a=E[W^(L+1) H^(L)_a],
    P^(L)_a=W^(L+1),
    P^(ell)_a=(W^(ell+1))^* delta^(ell+1)_a, ell<L,
    delta^(ell)_a=phi^(ell)'(Z^(ell)_a) P^(ell)_a.

The limiting equations are

    dot Z^(1)_a=-2 kappa_1 sum_b omega_b G_ab r_b delta^(1)_b,
    dot W^(ell)=-2 kappa_ell sum_b omega_b r_b
                                  delta^(ell)_b tensor H^(ell-1)_b, 2<=ell<=L,
    dot W^(L+1)=-2 kappa_(L+1) sum_b omega_b r_b H^(L)_b.                    (2)

A strong solution means these integral equations hold in L2 for the fields
and in operator norm for the matrices, continuously in time. The initial first
roots have the law of (W^(1)_0 x_a/sqrt(d))_a for a single row. For Gaussian
weights this is N(0,sigma_1^2 G). The initial operators are constructed from
the joint matrix/transpose limits, not replaced by independent backward maps.

Centered independent subGaussian first entries have uniformly subGaussian projections:
their moment bounds give E exp(t W_ij)<=exp(C B_in^2 t^2); independence then
gives E exp(t sum_j u_j W_ij)<=exp(C B_in^2 t^2 sum_j u_j^2).
Thus each initial Z^(1)_a has a marginal subGaussian bound depending only on
B_in X. No assumption of iid neuron coordinates after matrix reuse is made.

To obtain common spaces for different meshes, take the countable union of the
programs for rational meshes, their finite unions, rational linear
combinations and the coordinate operations needed here (including clipped
products). Their laws are consistent under deletion of instructions. Realize
these countably many laws jointly on each population and take the L2 closure
of the resulting fields. Operator inequalities pass from finite width to each
finite collection. Indeed a 1/4-net in each unit sphere gives

    P(||W^(ell)_0||_op>M)
       <=2*9^(2n)*exp[-n M^2/(8 sigma_ell^2)] -> 0                       (3)

for a sufficiently large fixed M (zero variance needs no bound). Since
||W^(ell)_0 v||_2/sqrt(n)<=M ||v||_2/sqrt(n), second-moment convergence gives
||W^(ell)_0 V||_L2<=M||V||_L2 on the generated span, hence on its closure.
The same argument gives the transpose map. The exact finite adjunction
identity passes to the limit and identifies it with the adjoint. Coordinate
operations extend wherever needed by clipping and L2 limits.

For the following fixed-computation response statements use A.1–A.2, with arbitrary iid subGaussian tuples admitted directly as roots.
For two states on these same spaces use the distance

    d(theta,theta_tilde)=max_a ||Z^(1)_a-Ztilde^(1)_a||_L2
       +sum_(ell=2)^L ||W^(ell)-Wtilde^(ell)||_op
       +||W^(L+1)-Wtilde^(L+1)||_L2.                                    (4)

At finite width replace every field L2 norm by ||b||_2/sqrt(n). No operator
distance between a finite matrix and a population operator is asserted.

Here is an explicit preliminary interval on which these norms stay bounded.
Let S be the maximum of the individual norms entering the state (not the
distance). Choose S0 so the initial norms are <=S0 with probability tending to
one, uniformly in the bound parameters, and are <=S0 in the population.
First-weight concentration is needed only over fixed m. Set B=2S0+2 and

    h_1=D0+D1 B,       h_ell=D0+D1 B h_(ell-1),
    d_ell=D1^(L-ell+1) B^(L-ell+1),
    R0=B h_L+Y.

On S<=B, all ||H^(ell)_a||_L2<=h_ell, ||delta^(ell)_a||_L2<=d_ell,
and |r_a|<=R0. The same inequalities hold at finite width. The norm of each
state velocity is therefore bounded by the corresponding member of

    2 kappa_1 X^2 R0 d_1,
    2 kappa_ell R0 d_ell h_(ell-1) (2<=ell<=L),
    2 kappa_(L+1) R0 h_L.

Let V0>=1 bound their sum. On

    T_ball=min(1,(B-S0)/(4 V0)),                                       (5)

Euler trajectories with mesh <=T_ball remain in S<=B through time 2 T_ball:
up to the first possible exit the cumulative increment is at most 2T_ball V0,
strictly less than B-S0. The same first-exit argument works for integral
solutions. It also bounds interpolation speeds, with a constant depending on
L. This requires only operator and RMS bounds, including for the readout.

#### The additional estimate uniform in the time mesh

The fixed-depth response lemma in Fragment C.2 derives,
on a further interval T_response>0, for every population Euler mesh Delta,

    sup_(k Delta<=T_response) max_(a,ell)
          E exp(c |P^(ell)_a,k|^2) <= C.                                (6)

It proves this for unbounded activations as well as nonvanishing subGaussian
readout. Its precise recurrences and noncircular choice of constants are part
of this proof, not an additional hypothesis of the theorem.

The important bounds in that derivation are entrywise response coefficients
|C^(ell)_(ak,bs)|<=c_ell Delta omega_b and bounded row sums of A^(ell).
SubGaussian norms of the forward fields and backward fields are bootstrapped
together. A derivative in a single backward slot starts with a pulse carrying
Delta omega_b. Every later random growth coefficient appears in a weighted
time sum Delta sum_(s,b) omega_b |P^(ell)_b,s|. Jensen's inequality bounds its
exponential using marginal subGaussian estimates; independence over time is
not assumed and no maximum of Gaussian fields over the mesh is taken.

Set T_*<=min(T_ball,T_response), with any additional reductions specified in
the lemma. The constants are functions of the displayed bounds only. In
particular they do not contain Delta or m.

#### Localization, existence, and uniqueness

Forward fields and predictions are Lipschitz in (4) on the ball S<=B, with
a constant depending on fixed depth and bound parameters. This follows by
expanding W H-Wtilde Htilde=(W-Wtilde)H+Wtilde(H-Htilde), and using
||phi(Z)-phi(Ztilde)||_L2<=D1||Z-Ztilde||_L2.

Backward fields require a cutoff. For any reference field Ptilde,

    ||[phi'(Z)-phi'(Ztilde)] Ptilde||_L2
       <=D2 R ||Z-Ztilde||_L2
           +2D1 ||Ptilde 1_(|Ptilde|>R)||_L2.                            (7)

Write a delta difference as

    phi'(Z)(P-Ptilde)+[phi'(Z)-phi'(Ztilde)]Ptilde.

For ell<L the difference P^(ell)-Ptilde^(ell) is bounded by
B||delta^(ell+1)-deltatilde^(ell+1)||_L2+C d; at ell=L it is a readout
difference. Downward substitution yields

    max_(a,ell)||delta^(ell)_a-deltatilde^(ell)_a||_L2
       <=C(1+R)d+C sum_(ell=1)^L max_a
                  ||Ptilde^(ell)_a 1_(|Ptilde^(ell)_a|>R)||_L2.

Each backward step multiplies the previous difference only by bounded
activation derivatives and bounded operators. The new cutoff term is added;
there is no power R^L. Outer-product differences satisfy
||u tensor v-utilde tensor vtilde||_op
 <=||u-utilde||_L2 ||v||_L2+||utilde||_L2 ||v-vtilde||_L2.
Together with (6), this proves for the vector field in (2)

    ||F(theta)-F(theta_reference)||
       <=C(1+R)d(theta,theta_reference)+C exp(-c R^2),                    (8)

when the reference is a population Euler grid state. Only the reference needs
the tail estimate.

Compare two piecewise linear population Euler interpolants. At time t their
assigned velocities are F evaluated at their respective preceding grid
states. These states differ by at most their interpolant distance plus
C(Delta+Delta'). Apply (8) directly to these grid states and integrate:

    sup_(t<=T_*) d(theta^Delta(t),theta^Delta'(t))
       <=C exp[C(1+R)T_*]
           ((1+R)(Delta+Delta')+exp(-cR^2)).                             (9)

First fix R and send both meshes to zero; then send R to infinity. Since
exp(CRT_*-cR^2)->0, the paths are Cauchy in the complete field/operator spaces.

All coordinate products occurring in F are continuous on these spaces.
For the only subtle product, if Z_j->Z and P_j->P in L2, split
phi'(Z_j)P_j-phi'(Z)P into the bounded multiplier times P_j-P and
[phi'(Z_j)-phi'(Z)]P. The latter converges in L2 by convergence in probability,
boundedness of phi', and uniform integrability against the single integrable
variable P^2. Thus F is continuous; on the compact range of a convergent
sequence of continuous paths this continuity is uniform. The Euler integral
equations pass to (2), giving a strong solution. All P fields converge at
fixed times; Fatou transfers (6) to the solution uniformly in time.

For any other strong solution with the same initial state, (5) bounds its
norms on this interval. Apply (8) with the constructed solution as reference.
Their distance is <=C exp(CRT_*-cR^2) for every R, hence zero. This proves
uniqueness without assuming tails of the competing solution.

Equations (2) use only the current fields, operators, and adjoints. More
precisely, the closed spaces generated by a current state under these
operations and clipped products contain all its subsequent Euler
approximations and their limits. Equal current joint action laws identify
these spaces by an L2 isometry intertwining the operators and coordinate
operations. Uniqueness identifies their subsequent laws. This is autonomy
and restartability on the constructed interval, not a finite scalar closure.

#### From the population flow to every vanishing-step finite GD sequence

Fix a rational coarse mesh Delta, independently of eta_n. Expand

    W^(ell)_k=W^(ell)_0-2 kappa_ell Delta
          sum_(s<k,b) omega_b r_b,s delta^(ell)_b,s tensor H^(ell-1)_b,s.   (10)

Build a finite oracle computation using the same sampled initial arrays as
actual GD. In its expanded matrix actions replace all scalar contractions
and residuals by their deterministic population Euler values. This is a
fixed finite program, so the stated theorem gives joint empirical convergence
of every needed node, contraction, second moment, and continuous quadratic
tail cutoff. Its coefficients are a proof device determined by the population
Euler equations; they are not the coefficients of the final autonomous flow.

Construct proxy parameters from the oracle's first-layer/readout nodes and
the finite rank expansion corresponding to (10), with u v^top/n. Applying a
proxy matrix to an oracle node differs from its prescribed oracle action by
finitely many terms of the form

    -2 kappa_ell Delta omega_b r_b,s delta^(ell)_b,s,oracle
       ((h^(ell-1)_b,s,oracle)^top h^(ell-1)_a,k,oracle/n
                         -E[H^(ell-1)_b,s H^(ell-1)_a,k]),               (11)

and transpose actions have the corresponding delta contractions. At fixed
Delta, their scalar errors vanish and their vector RMS norms are bounded.
Consequently all proxy forward quantities are consistent in RMS. To transfer
backpropagation with an unbounded readout, use (7) against oracle P nodes and
proceed downward through layers. At any fixed cutoff the errors vanish, and
the empirical oracle tails converge to the tails in (6); sending that cutoff
to infinity proves the recomputed proxy delta fields are consistent in RMS.
This also proves consistency of its vector field and residuals.

The proxy grid fields therefore have reference tails with limiting upper
bound C exp(-cR^2), after harmless changes in constants. For example if
||v-u||_2/sqrt(n)=e_n then

    ||v 1_(|v|>2R)||_2/sqrt(n)
       <=2 e_n+2||u 1_(|u|>R)||_2/sqrt(n).

Its grid and interpolated norm/speed bounds have limiting upper bounds
independent of Delta, by (5), (10), and the fixed-mesh consistency. Enlarge
the comparison ball by a fixed amount if necessary.

Compare actual GD and the proxy interpolant using their assigned grid
velocities. The actual preceding fine-grid state and reference preceding
coarse-grid state are at distance at most the interpolant distance plus
C(eta_n+Delta). The actual-to-proxy vector-field difference obeys (8), now
with empirical reference tails and fixed-mesh errors. Thus

    sup_(t<=T_*) d_n(theta_n^GD(t),theta_n^proxy,Delta(t))
       <=C exp[C(1+R)T_*]
          ((1+R)(eta_n+Delta)+exp(-cR^2)+o_P(1)).                         (12)

Here o_P(1) is at fixed R,Delta. Initial distance is zero because the oracle
uses the same roots. A vanishing initialization perturbation contributes its
distance to the right side. The actual GD requires only its RMS/operator
ball, not a maximum coordinate bound or an empirical tail theorem for a
growing number of steps.

The limit order is: n->infinity with R,Delta fixed, then Delta->0, then
R->infinity. Equation (12), (9), and fixed-mesh empirical convergence prove
the joint width/step limit. There is no condition such as eta_n sqrt(n)->0.

Predictions follow by the forward Lipschitz bound. Define the kernel blocks

    K^(1)_ab=G_ab E[delta^(1)_a delta^(1)_b],
    K^(ell)_ab=E[H^(ell-1)_a H^(ell-1)_b]
                      E[delta^(ell)_a delta^(ell)_b], 2<=ell<=L,
    K^(L+1)_ab=E[H^(L)_a H^(L)_b],
    K=sum_(ell=1)^(L+1) kappa_ell K^(ell).

Their finite counterparts use b^top c/n in every contraction. Backward RMS
consistency and Cauchy--Schwarz give uniform convergence of these entries.
For Omega=diag(omega_1,...,omega_m), direct differentiation gives

    dot f=-2 K Omega r,        dot L=-4 (Omega r)^top K (Omega r).         (13)

Each block is positive semidefinite, being a parameter-gradient Gram matrix.

For completeness, the extra observable steps do not demand higher moments
of actual GD. The population parameter velocities converge uniformly in L2
and operator norm by (8). Recursively,

    dot Z^(ell)_a=dot W^(ell) H^(ell-1)_a
                    +W^(ell)[phi^(ell-1)'(Z^(ell-1)_a) dot Z^(ell-1)_a]   (14)

is continuous in the state and parameter velocity in the stated norms.
The bounded-multiplier product is justified by the same fixed-reference
uniform-integrability argument used after (9). On the compact population
time path these velocities form a compact L2 family, hence have uniformly
vanishing L2 tails. For each fixed Delta, oracle evaluations of these
velocities are fixed finite programs and have convergent empirical cutoff
moments. Localizing their bounded-multiplier products, first using (12),
then passing Delta to zero, proves convergence of the integrated squared
hidden speeds. No exponential estimate for these derived velocities is
needed; cutoffs here occur after state stability, outside Gronwall.

At any grid with cell length at most epsilon, each absolutely continuous
coordinate path obeys

    sup_(s,t in one cell)|z(t)-z(s)|^2
         <=epsilon integral_cell |dot z(u)|^2 du.

After averaging over neurons and summing over cells, the error of grid
reconstruction in squared uniform path norm is <=C epsilon, uniformly in n
on the ball. Fixed-time empirical joint laws converge in Wasserstein distance
of order two by fixed-program convergence and their second moments. Combining
this with grid reconstruction proves assertion 3. Activations follow from
their Lipschitz bounds. The same cutoff induction proves assertion 4: an
operator amplifies L2 errors by at most B, Lipschitz functions preserve them,
and bounded-factor products use the compact reference L2 family's uniform
integrability. This explains the stated restriction on products.

#### Removing second differentiability; losses and initialization perturbations

First the proof above is for C2 activations with bounded first two
derivatives. For a C1 activation whose derivative is globally Lipschitz,
convolve with a smooth compactly supported probability density of scale
epsilon. Then

    ||phi_epsilon-phi||_infinity<=C D1 epsilon,
    ||phi_epsilon'-phi'||_infinity<=C D2 epsilon,
    ||phi_epsilon'||_infinity<=D1,    ||phi_epsilon''||_infinity<=D2.

The response lemma and T_* depend only on these bounds, uniformly in
epsilon. Include rational smoothing scales in the common program family.
The comparison (8) between different smoothings has an additional
C(1+R)(epsilon+epsilon') term: forward differences gain O(epsilon), and
backward differences use (7) plus the uniform difference of derivatives.
The same ordered limits construct a strong flow for the original activation,
inherit (6), and prove uniqueness. Compare finite GD for the original
activation with the fixed smooth oracle by the identical estimate, adding
C(1+R)epsilon inside (12). Taking n,Delta,epsilon,R in that order proves the
same joint limit for C1,1 activations. ReLU's discontinuous derivative does
not satisfy this argument.

More general separable losses are allowed: use sum_a omega_a ell_a(f_a),
where every ell_a is C1 and its derivative is locally Lipschitz, with common
finite bounds and Lipschitz constants on bounded prediction intervals.
Replace every 2r_b in (1),(2),(10)--(12) by ell_b'(f_b). The preliminary ball
uses sup_(a,|f|<=B h_L)|ell_a'(f)| in place of 2R0; prediction stability uses
the corresponding local Lipschitz constant. In response differentiation these
oracle coefficients are frozen, so every response estimate uses only their
bound and the pulse still carries Delta omega_b. The proof is unchanged
with exactly these replacements. No convexity or global growth assumption
on the loss is required on this short interval. For this loss,
dot f_a=-sum_b K_ab omega_b ell_b'(f_b), and
dot L=-sum_ab omega_a ell_a'(f_a) K_ab omega_b ell_b'(f_b).

Finally (12) also allows perturbing the sampled initial arrays by an amount
tending to zero in probability in (4), and changing the kappa constants by
vanishing amounts. The actual initial arrays need only the resulting RMS
and operator bounds. In particular zero population readout covers finite
Gaussian readout sigma_out n^(-beta) g for EVERY beta>0, and indeed any
readout perturbation with ||W^(L+1)_0||_2/sqrt(n)->0 in probability. This
does not assert universality for different O(1) non-Gaussian middle matrices:
such a replacement need not be small in operator norm.

### C.2. Complete weighted response and tail proof

Within this proof unit, unqualified section and equation numbers are local.

Fix a finite number \(L\ge2\) of hidden layers and a finite dataset with
weights \(\omega_a>0\), \(\sum_a\omega_a=1\). Suppose
\(|G_{ab}|\le g\). No inverse Gram matrix is used. Each activation
\(\phi^{(\ell)}\) is \(C^2\), with

\[
\max_\ell\bigl(|\phi^{(\ell)}(0)|+
\|\phi^{(\ell)\prime}\|_\infty+
\|\phi^{(\ell)\prime\prime}\|_\infty\bigr)<\infty.
\]

The first-layer root vector has uniformly subGaussian scalar marginals.
The readout root \(W_0^{(L+1)}\) is subGaussian. Roots and initial middle
matrices are independent, and the middle matrices have independent
Gaussian entries with variance \(\sigma_\ell^2/n\).
The lemma below only uses the marginal subGaussian bounds on the resulting
first preactivations and readout.

All constants are independent of the Euler mesh, the number of mesh points,
the number of inputs, the individual weights, and covariance ranks. They
can depend on fixed depth, activation bounds, \(g\), initialization bounds,
learning constants, and the preliminary RMS/residual bounds. A common
existence time across datasets does not imply a width limit for a dataset
whose size increases with width.

#### Exact recursions and hypotheses

For mesh \(\Delta\), write the population forward and backward operations
as

\[
H_{a,k}^{(\ell)}=\phi^{(\ell)}(Z_{a,k}^{(\ell)}),\qquad
P_{a,k}^{(L)}=W_k^{(L+1)},\qquad
\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}=
\phi^{(\ell)\prime}(Z_{a,k}^{(\ell)})P_{a,k}^{(\ell)}.
\tag{1}
\]

For \(\ell<L\), \(P_{a,k}^{(\ell)}=
(W_k^{(\ell+1)})^*\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell+1)}\). The Euler updates at the
two ends are

\[
Z_{a,k+1}^{(1)}=Z_{a,k}^{(1)}
-2\kappa_1\Delta\sum_b\omega_bG_{ab}r_{b,k}
\delta_{b,k}^{(1)},
\tag{2}
\]
\[
W_{k+1}^{(L+1)}=W_k^{(L+1)}
-2\kappa_{L+1}\Delta\sum_b\omega_b r_{b,k}H_{b,k}^{(L)}.
\tag{3}
\]

For every middle layer the update is

\[
W_{k+1}^{(\ell)}=W_k^{(\ell)}
-2\kappa_\ell\Delta\sum_b\omega_b r_{b,k}
\delta_{b,k}^{(\ell)}\otimes H_{b,k}^{(\ell-1)}.
\tag{4}
\]

For the lemma, the residuals in these recursions can be any deterministic
numbers with \(|r_{a,k}|\le R\). All deterministic residuals, contractions,
response coefficients, and Gaussian covariance laws are frozen in every
derivative below. There is no derivative through expectations.

Assume on a preliminary time interval \([0,T_{\rm ball}]\) that all source
RMS norms \(\|H_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\|_{L^2}\) and
\(\|\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\|_{L^2}\) are at most \(S\), uniformly in mesh.
In particular the training-memory coefficient bound is

\[
J=2\max_\ell\kappa_\ell R S^2,
\tag{5}
\]

and all Gaussian innovations below have standard deviations at most
\(S\max_\ell\sigma_\ell\).

For each initial middle matrix introduce forward slots
\(\xi_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\) and backward slots
\(\eta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\). Their covariances are

\[
\mathbb E[\xi_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\xi_{b,s}^{(\ell)}]
=\sigma_\ell^2\mathbb E[H_{a,k}^{(\ell-1)}H_{b,s}^{(\ell-1)}],
\quad
\mathbb E[\eta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\eta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}]
=\sigma_\ell^2\mathbb E[\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\delta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}].
\tag{6}
\]

Different matrix/orientation families are independent Gaussian families;
each family's own times and inputs are generally dependent. The
coordinate space of hidden population \(\ell\) uses its adjacent slots
\(\xi^{(\ell)}\) and \(\eta^{(\ell+1)}\), with the appropriate root at
the first/last layer. These are distinct neuron populations, not paired
finite-width coordinates.

Define unscaled expected derivatives

\[
A_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}=
\mathbb E\frac{\partial\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}}
{\partial\xi_{b,s}^{(\ell)}},\qquad s\le k,
\quad
C_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}=
\mathbb E\frac{\partial H_{a,k}^{(\ell-1)}}
{\partial\eta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}},\qquad s<k.
\tag{7}
\]

The exact local response representation is

\[
Z_{a,k}^{(\ell)}=\xi_{a,k}^{(\ell)}+
\sum_{b,s<k}F_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}\delta_{b,s}^{(\ell)},
\tag{8}
\]
\[
P_{a,k}^{(\ell-1)}=\eta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}+
\sum_{b,s\le k}D_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}H_{b,s}^{(\ell-1)},
\tag{9}
\]

where

\[
F_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}=
\sigma_\ell^2 C_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}
-2\kappa_\ell\Delta\omega_b r_{b,s}
\mathbb E[H_{b,s}^{(\ell-1)}H_{a,k}^{(\ell-1)}],
\tag{10}
\]
\[
D_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}=
\sigma_\ell^2 A_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}
-\mathbf1_{s<k}2\kappa_\ell\Delta\omega_b r_{b,s}
\mathbb E[\delta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}].
\tag{11}
\]

For compact cap notation only, put
\(\widetilde A^{(\ell)}=\sigma_\ell^2 A^{(\ell)}\) and
\(\widetilde C^{(\ell)}=\sigma_\ell^2 C^{(\ell)}\).
Thus the sigma factors never enter the trained terms.

#### SubGaussian sums without maxima of Gaussian histories

For a scalar random variable define

\[
\mathcal N(U)=\sup_{p\ge2}\frac{\|U\|_{L^p}}{\sqrt p}.
\tag{12}
\]

It is a norm, and \(\mathcal N(U)\le B\) implies

\[
\mathbb E\exp\bigl(U^2/(8eB^2)\bigr)\le4/3,
\quad
\mathbb E e^{\lambda|U|}\le(4/3)e^{2e\lambda^2B^2}.
\tag{13}
\]

Indeed the \(r\)-th term in the first exponential series is at most
\((2r)^r/((8e)^rr!)\le4^{-r}\); the second inequality follows by
\(\lambda|U|\le U^2/(8eB^2)+2e\lambda^2B^2\). The case \(B=0\) is
understood as \(U=0\).

If each \(U_{b,s}\) has \(\mathcal N(U_{b,s})\le B\), Jensen applied
with weights \(\Delta\omega_b/(k\Delta)\) gives

\[
\mathbb E\exp\left(\lambda\Delta
\sum_{s<k}\sum_b\omega_b|U_{b,s}|\right)
\le(4/3)\exp(2e\lambda^2T^2B^2),\qquad k\Delta\le T.
\tag{14}
\]

This requires no independence over time or inputs. The maximum of Gaussian
coordinates or of a Gaussian history is never bounded in this argument.

#### The simultaneous field and response bounds

We prove that there exist fixed finite caps \(a_\ell,c_\ell\), constants
\(B_H,B_{P,\ell}\), and \(T_0>0\), with \(T_0\le T_{\rm ball}\), such
that at every mesh point up to \(T_0\)

\[
\sum_{b,s\le k}|\widetilde A_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|\le a_\ell,
\qquad
|\widetilde C_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|\le c_\ell\Delta\omega_b,
\tag{15}
\]
\[
\mathcal N(H_{a,k}^{(\ell)})\le B_H,
\qquad
\mathcal N(P_{a,k}^{(\ell)})\le B_{P,\ell}.
\tag{16}
\]

Set \(f_\ell=c_\ell+J\) for \(\ell\ge2\), and \(f_1=1\).
Under the response caps,

\[
|F_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|\le f_\ell\Delta\omega_b,
\qquad
\sum_{b,s\le k}|D_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|\le a_\ell+JT.
\tag{17}
\]

Choose a constant \(K\ge2\), depending only on the fixed bounds in the
lemma, large enough to dominate every root/innovation \(\mathcal N\)-norm
after applying an activation and every coefficient in (2)--(3). Fix this
\(K\) once. The triangle inequality for \(\mathcal N\), (1)--(3), and
(8)--(9) give the following bounds using only already constructed fields:

\[
\mathcal N(H_{a,k}^{(1)})\le K+KT\sup_{b,s<k}
\mathcal N(P_{b,s}^{(1)}),
\tag{18}
\]
\[
\mathcal N(H_{a,k}^{(\ell)})\le K+Kf_\ell T
\sup_{b,s<k}\mathcal N(P_{b,s}^{(\ell)}),\quad 2\le\ell\le L,
\tag{19}
\]
\[
\mathcal N(P_{a,k}^{(\ell)})\le K+(a_{\ell+1}+JT)
\sup_{b,s\le k}\mathcal N(H_{b,s}^{(\ell)}),\quad\ell<L,
\tag{20}
\]
\[
\mathcal N(W_k^{(L+1)})\le K+KT
\sup_{b,s<k}\mathcal N(H_{b,s}^{(L)}).
\tag{21}
\]

Take

\[
B_H=2K,\qquad B_{P,L}=2K,\qquad
B_{P,\ell}=4K(1+a_{\ell+1})\quad(\ell<L).
\tag{22}
\]

Once response caps have been chosen, (18)--(21) preserve these field caps
if \(JT\le1\), \(2KT\le1\), and
\(f_\ell T B_{P,\ell}\le1\) for every \(1\le\ell\le L\).
For (20), its right side is at most
\(K+2K(a_{\ell+1}+1)\le4K(1+a_{\ell+1})\).
For each finite mesh all \(\mathcal N\)-norms are finite before this
estimate: the causal magnitude recursions bound each field by a finite
deterministic linear combination of absolute roots/innovations, since
\(|\phi(z)|\le M(1+|z|)\) and \(|\delta|\le M|P|\).

#### Full forward-slot derivative rows

Fix a layer \(2\le\ell\le L\). Differentiate only with respect to its
own forward slots \(\xi^{(\ell)}\); hold the adjacent backward slots and
roots fixed. Let

\[
v_{a,k}^{(\ell)}=
\sum_{b,s\le k}\left|
\frac{\partial Z_{a,k}^{(\ell)}}{\partial\xi_{b,s}^{(\ell)}}
\right|,\qquad
V_k^{(\ell)}=\max_{a,u\le k}v_{a,u}^{(\ell)}.
\tag{23}
\]

The maximum here is a maximum of derivative row sums, not of random
backward fields. Write \(d_\ell=1+a_{\ell+1}\) if \(\ell<L\), and
\(d_L=1\). Let \(M\ge1\) dominate all activation bounds.

For \(\ell<L\), direct differentiation of (9) gives

\[
\sum_{b,s}\left|
\frac{\partial P_{a,u}^{(\ell)}}{\partial\xi_{b,s}^{(\ell)}}
\right|
\le M(a_{\ell+1}+JT)V_u^{(\ell)}.
\tag{24}
\]

For the last layer, differentiating the integrated readout update (3)
instead gives a bound \(2\kappa_{L+1}RMTV_u^{(L)}\).
The product rule in (1), with these bounds, proves for a fixed constant
\(C\) depending only on the lemma's data that

\[
\sum_{b,s}\left|
\frac{\partial\delta_{a,u}^{(\ell)}}
{\partial\xi_{b,s}^{(\ell)}}\right|
\le C\bigl(|P_{a,u}^{(\ell)}|+d_\ell\bigr)V_u^{(\ell)}.
\tag{25}
\]

The first term in (8) has derivative row sum exactly one. Its memory has
only earlier times. By the entrywise estimate (17),

\[
V_k^{(\ell)}\le1+Cf_\ell\Delta\sum_{u<k}
\left(d_\ell+\sum_b\omega_b|P_{b,u}^{(\ell)}|\right)V_u^{(\ell)}.
\tag{26}
\]

To justify the prefix maximum, the bound for every earlier time is no
larger than the displayed right side because every summand is nonnegative.
Discrete Gronwall gives

\[
V_k^{(\ell)}\le
\exp\left(Cf_\ell T d_\ell+
Cf_\ell\Delta\sum_{u<k}\sum_b\omega_b|P_{b,u}^{(\ell)}|\right).
\tag{27}
\]

Using (14), then Cauchy--Schwarz in (25), yields

\[
\sum_{b,s\le k}|\widetilde A_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|
\le C(B_{P,\ell}+d_\ell)
\exp\left(Cf_\ell T d_\ell+
Cf_\ell^2T^2B_{P,\ell}^2\right).
\tag{28}
\]

Here and in the remaining estimates choose one \(C\ge1\) large enough
for all displayed inequalities, and fix it before choosing response caps.
There are finitely many algebraic bound types; neither \(C\) nor \(K\)
depends on a response cap. Notice that (28) uses
\(\|P_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\|_{L^2}\|V_k^{(\ell)}\|_{L^2}\), not the
\(L^2\)-norm of a maximum over the input index or time.

#### A single backward-slot pulse

Fix \(\ell\ge2\), one input \(b\), one time \(s\), and differentiate
the local coordinate functions of layer \(\ell-1\) with respect to the
single slot \(\eta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}\). Put

\[
D_k=\max_{a,u\le k}\left|
\frac{\partial Z_{a,u}^{(\ell-1)}}
{\partial\eta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}}\right|.
\tag{29}
\]

It vanishes for \(k\le s\). Differentiating (9) and (1) gives, pointwise,

\[
\left|\frac{\partial\delta_{a,u}^{(\ell-1)}}
{\partial\eta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}}\right|
\le M\mathbf1_{a=b,u=s}
+C\bigl(|P_{a,u}^{(\ell-1)}|+d_{\ell-1}\bigr)D_u.
\tag{30}
\]

Indeed the derivative of the direct Gaussian term in (9) is precisely
\(\mathbf1_{a=b,u=s}\); the derivative of its response has magnitude
at most \(M(a_\ell+JT)D_u\). The other product-rule term is bounded by
\(M|P_{a,u}^{(\ell-1)}|D_u\).

For \(\ell=2\), insert (30) in the accumulated update (2). Its direct
pulse has magnitude at most \(2\kappa_1gRM\Delta\omega_b\).
For \(\ell\ge3\), insert it in (8) for layer \(\ell-1\); the direct
pulse has magnitude at most \(Mf_{\ell-1}\Delta\omega_b\).
Both cases therefore obey, for \(k>s\),

\[
D_k\le Cf_{\ell-1}\Delta\omega_b+
Cf_{\ell-1}\Delta\sum_{u<k}
\left(d_{\ell-1}+\sum_a\omega_a|P_{a,u}^{(\ell-1)}|\right)D_u.
\tag{31}
\]

Here \(f_1=1\). Gronwall, (14), and the bounded activation derivative
give

\[
\frac{|\widetilde C_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|}{\Delta\omega_b}
\le Cf_{\ell-1}
\exp\left(Cf_{\ell-1}T d_{\ell-1}+
Cf_{\ell-1}^2T^2B_{P,\ell-1}^2\right).
\tag{32}
\]

The factor \(\Delta\omega_b\) is retained from one source pulse. There
is no factor \(1/\omega_b\) in any constant and no sum of unweighted
Gaussian absolute values.

#### Cap selection and literal construction order

First choose the forward-response caps from bottom to top:

\[
c_2=4C,\qquad c_\ell=4C(c_{\ell-1}+J),\quad3\le\ell\le L.
\tag{33}
\]

These use only the \(T=0\) prefactors in (32), which do not contain any
backward cap. Next choose the backward-response caps from top to bottom:

\[
a_L=4C(2K+1),\qquad
a_\ell=4C(4K+1)(1+a_{\ell+1}),\quad 2\le\ell<L.
\tag{34}
\]

These dominate four times the \(T=0\) prefactors of (28), using (22).
All caps are now fixed finite numbers. Choose \(T_0>0\) satisfying

\[
T_0\le\min(T_{\rm ball},1),\quad JT_0\le1,\quad2KT_0\le1,
\quad f_\ell T_0 B_{P,\ell}\le1\quad(1\le\ell\le L),
\tag{35}
\]

and such that every exponent on the right sides of (28) and (32) is at
most \(\log2\) when \(T=T_0\). Each exponent tends to zero with \(T\)
after the caps have been fixed; there are finitely many of them. Thus this
choice gives a strictly positive time depending only on the stated data.
Equations (28) and (32) then improve their respective response caps by a
factor of two.

For completeness, this is an induction on the actual causal construction,
not a bootstrap that assumes all future tails:

1. At time \(k\), \(W_k^{(L+1)}\) and \(Z_{a,k}^{(1)}\) use only
   histories before \(k\). Verify their bounds from (18), (21).
2. Construct the current forward layers in order \(2,\ldots,L\).
   Before constructing layer \(\ell\), its coefficient
   \(\widetilde C^{(\ell)}\) is computed from the already constructed
   \(H^{(\ell-1)}\). Estimate (32) uses only past
   \(P^{(\ell-1)}\), whose tails and backward response caps are known,
   and the current lower-layer forward cap, which is already known.
   Equation (19) then verifies the current \(H^{(\ell)}\) bound using
   only past \(P^{(\ell)}\). This constructs the current innovations'
   source covariances too.
3. Construct the current backward layers in order \(L,\ldots,2\).
   At the top \(P^{(L)}=W^{(L+1)}\) is already bounded. At a lower
   layer \(\ell\), the current \(P^{(\ell)}\) was just constructed
   using the current higher response \(\widetilde A^{(\ell+1)}\);
   (20) verifies its cap. Hence (25)--(28) use known current
   \(P^{(\ell)}\) tails and known upper response coefficients. They
   verify the current \(\widetilde A^{(\ell)}\) cap, after which (9)
   constructs \(P^{(\ell-1)}\).
4. Apply (2)--(3) for the next step and repeat.

At \(k=0\) there is no forward response memory. The same top-down
backward construction starts from the readout root; (28) has \(V_0=1\).
Thus the induction starts without zero-readout or centered-readout
assumptions. Neither a current forward coefficient nor a current backward
coefficient needs its own unconstructed value. This proves (15)--(16).

In particular, for some fixed \(c_*,C_*>0\),

\[
\sup_\Delta\sup_{k\Delta\le T_0}\max_{a,\ell}
\mathbb E\exp\left(c_*|P_{a,k}^{(\ell)}|^2\right)\le C_*.
\tag{36}
\]

The same statement holds for every hidden activation and, by (2) and
(8), every preactivation. It implies the uniform RMS cutoff-tail bound
\(\|P\mathbf1_{|P|>R}\|_{L^2}\le C e^{-cR^2}\), after decreasing
\(c\). No bound on a maximum over neurons, dataset elements, or time was
proved or needed.

The proof also holds for arbitrary deterministic positive step lengths
\(\Delta_s\) with total time at most \(T_0\): replace every source factor
\(\Delta\omega_b\) at time \(s\) by \(\Delta_s\omega_b\), and replace
\(k\Delta\) by \(\sum_{s<k}\Delta_s\). The Jensen weights in (14) become
\(\Delta_s\omega_b/\sum_{u<k}\Delta_u\); the single-slot pulse in (31) is
exactly \(\Delta_s\omega_b\); every Gronwall estimate uses only total
time. Nothing else changes. Consequently (36) also holds for fields
recomputed at an affine Euler-state interpolation time: append one final
Euler update of length \(\theta\Delta\), \(0<\theta<1\), to the preceding
full steps, and evaluate the full forward/backward network there. The
constants are independent of \(\theta\). This bounds each interpolation
time; it is not a tail bound for a supremum of the path.

#### Consequences and boundaries

The depth extension therefore supplies the required Gaussian-tail part of
the reference comparison for smooth globally Lipschitz activations,
including when their values and the initial readout are unbounded. The
remaining proof must provide the preliminary RMS/operator ball, the
common operator realization, the oracle interpolation comparison, and its
order of limits. This proof unit does not certify those separate steps.

The exact same lemma holds when each \(2r_{a,k}\) in (2)--(4) is replaced
by any deterministic coefficient uniformly bounded on the preliminary
ball. This permits a general-loss theorem once that theorem proves the
required boundedness and feedback Lipschitz estimate for the loss
derivative.

The constants only use uniform bounds on \(\phi\)'s value at zero and
its first two derivatives. Thus this lemma is uniform under smooth
mollifications of globally Lipschitz \(C^{1,1}\) activations. Passing from
the mollified flows to the original activation still requires the
separate stability argument. ReLU has discontinuous derivative and is not
covered by this lemma or this mollification statement.

The proof is for every fixed finite depth; its constants can grow rapidly
with depth. It proves neither a depth-uniform interval nor arbitrary-depth
strict feature activity. Those are different claims.

The response rule in (6)–(11) follows from A.2 at each fixed finite C2 program. Named sources and deterministic coefficients are frozen when differentiating. This handles singular covariances and does not invoke an all-moment scalar-feedback theorem.

### C.3. Gaussian strict-activity corollary

Within this proof unit, unqualified section and equation numbers are local.

This proof unit proves the strict nontriviality part of the two-hidden-layer population result. It is conditional on existence of the population gradient flow with the mean-square continuity specified below. It does not, by itself, establish an existence theorem or a width limit for its whole activation class.

The useful conclusion is broad: **bounded, nonconstant, continuously differentiable activations with bounded derivatives are sufficient**, in both hidden layers. Neither activation needs to be odd, analytic, monotone, or strictly monotone. Derivatives may change sign and may vanish on intervals. Thus bounded nonconstant \(C^2\) activations with bounded derivatives certainly qualify. A broader conditional version allows unbounded activations with bounded continuous derivatives, provided both activations are nonaffine.

#### Setup and conclusion

Fix \(m<\infty\) inputs \(x_a\in\mathbb R^d\) with
\[
\frac{\|x_a\|_2^2}{d}=1,
\qquad
G_{ab}=\frac{x_a^\top x_b}{d},
\qquad |G_{ab}|<1\quad(a\ne b).
\]
The Gram matrix \(G\) may be singular. Let every label \(y_a\) be a nonzero real number; arbitrary sign labels are included. Fix \(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\kappa_1,\kappa_2,\kappa_3>0\).

Use \(\phi^{(1)}\) and \(\phi^{(2)}\) for the two activations. In the simple sufficient class both are bounded, nonconstant, continuously differentiable, with bounded derivatives. Initialize the first-layer population roots by
\[
Z_{0,a}^{(1)}
=\frac{\sigma_1 g^\top x_a}{\sqrt d},
\qquad g\sim N(0,I_d),
\]
the middle action by the joint forward/adjoint limit of an independent matrix with entries \(N(0,\sigma_2^2/n)\), and the rescaled population readout by \(W_0^{(3)}=0\).

The network quantities are
\[
H_a^{(1)}=\phi^{(1)}(Z_a^{(1)}),
\qquad
Z_a^{(2)}=W^{(2)}H_a^{(1)},
\qquad
H_a^{(2)}=\phi^{(2)}(Z_a^{(2)}),
\]
\[
f_a=\mathbb E[W^{(3)}H_a^{(2)}],
\qquad r_a=f_a-y_a,
\qquad L=\sum_a r_a^2,
\]
\[
\delta_a^{(2)}=W^{(3)}(\phi^{(2)})'(Z_a^{(2)}),
\qquad
\delta_a^{(1)}
=(\phi^{(1)})'(Z_a^{(1)})(W^{(2)})^*\delta_a^{(2)}.
\]
Suppose the limiting flow satisfies
\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot Z_a^{(1)}
&=-2\kappa_1\sum_bG_{ab}r_b\delta_b^{(1)},\\
\dot W^{(2)}
&=-2\kappa_2\sum_b r_b\delta_b^{(2)}\otimes H_b^{(1)},\\
\dot W^{(3)}
&=-2\kappa_3\sum_b r_bH_b^{(2)},
\end{aligned}\tag{1}
\]
where \((u\otimes v)V=u\mathbb E[vV]\). Write \(\|U\|_{L^2}=\sqrt{\mathbb E[U^2]}\) for root-mean-square size; the operator norm measures its largest amplification. Require continuity of the field variables in mean square and of the middle action in operator norm, with the corresponding integral equations valid in those norms. The bounded continuous activation derivatives then justify the directional chain rules used below. The two neuron populations remain separate; every expectation pairs coordinates of the same layer.

There is a fixed \(T_*>0\) on which the following hold:

- For every input, both hidden preactivations move nontrivially. Their RMS speeds are positive for every \(0<t\le T_*\), of order \(t\); their squared displacements are of order \(t^4\).
- The trained middle matrix moves nontrivially when applied to each fixed initial first-layer activation.
- All three kernel blocks are positive definite for \(0<t\le T_*\), and each block is nonconstant.
- The summed loss has a uniformly negative slope, including at initialization.
- Every hidden marginal has variance and best-affine-fit error for its activation bounded below by positive constants on \([0,T_*]\).

The time and constants depend on the fixed data, activations, labels, and positive parameters, but not on width or learning rate. Strict positivity is not claimed uniformly as the inputs become parallel, labels approach zero, or other nondegeneracy parameters approach their boundaries.

#### Why the first activation Gram matrix is positive definite

The key geometric fact needs no high derivatives or analyticity.

**Bounded ridge-function independence.** If \(\phi\) is bounded, continuous, and nonconstant, then the functions
\[
w\longmapsto\phi\!\left(\frac{w^\top x_a}{\sqrt d}\right),
\qquad a=1,\ldots,m,
\]
are linearly independent whenever the inputs are pairwise nonparallel.

To prove it, suppose a linear combination with coefficients \(c_a\) is zero for every \(w\), and select \(a\) with \(c_a\ne0\). For every \(b\ne a\), set
\[
\xi_{ab}
=
\frac{x_a/\sqrt d-G_{ab}x_b/\sqrt d}{1-G_{ab}^2}.
\]
Then
\[
\frac{x_a^\top\xi_{ab}}{\sqrt d}=1,
\qquad
\frac{x_b^\top\xi_{ab}}{\sqrt d}=0.
\]
For a vector \(v\), let \(\Delta_v F(w)=F(w+v)-F(w)\). Apply the commuting differences
\[
\prod_{b\ne a}\Delta_{h\xi_{ab}}
\]
to the proposed linear identity. Every term other than the \(a\)-th is killed by one of these differences. Each difference shifts the \(a\)-th scalar argument by \(h\). Therefore
\[
\Delta_h^{m-1}\phi(s)=0
\qquad\text{for every }s,h\in\mathbb R.
\tag{2}
\]
For fixed \(s,h\), the bounded sequence \(a_j=\phi(s+jh)\), \(j\ge0\), has vanishing \((m-1)\)-st differences. This forces it to be constant: its \((m-2)\)-nd difference is constant; if that constant were nonzero, the next lower difference would grow linearly, contradicting boundedness of every difference of a bounded sequence. Repeating gives \(a_{j+1}=a_j\). For \(m=2\) this is immediate from (2), and \(m=1\) is immediate from nonconstancy. Consequently \(\phi(s+h)=\phi(s)\) for every \(s,h\), contradicting nonconstancy. This proves the claim.

Now define
\[
Q_{ab}=\mathbb E[H_{0,a}^{(1)}H_{0,b}^{(1)}].
\tag{3}
\]
If \(c^\top Qc=0\), then \(\sum_a c_a\phi^{(1)}(\sigma_1g^\top x_a/\sqrt d)=0\) almost surely. Continuity and the full support of \(\sigma_1g\) make this an identity for all \(w\). The preceding argument forces \(c=0\). Hence \(Q\) is positive definite, even when \(G\) is singular.

There is a useful broader version. If \(\phi^{(1)}\) is nonaffine and continuously differentiable with bounded derivative, then its derivative is bounded, continuous, and nonconstant. Differentiate a putative ridge identity in a direction \(v\) with \(v^\top x_a\ne0\) for all \(a\); such a direction avoids finitely many proper hyperplanes. It gives a linear identity among the ridge functions of \((\phi^{(1)})'\), with coefficients \(c_a v^\top x_a/\sqrt d\). Bounded ridge-function independence again makes every \(c_a=0\). Thus \(Q\succ0\) also holds for unbounded nonaffine first activations with bounded continuous derivative.

#### Positive response covariances, including activation flat parts

Write
\[
Y_a:=Z_{0,a}^{(2)}.
\]
The tuple \(Y\) is centered Gaussian with covariance \(\sigma_2^2Q\), so it has full support in \(\mathbb R^m\). Define the following recurring quantities:
\[
\begin{aligned}
S&=\sum_a y_a\phi^{(2)}(Y_a),
&U_a&=S(\phi^{(2)})'(Y_a),\\
P_a&=(W_0^{(2)})^*U_a,
&B_a&=(\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,a}^{(1)})P_a,\\
V_{ab}&=\mathbb E[U_aU_b],
&D_{ab}&=\mathbb E[B_aB_b].
\end{aligned}\tag{4}
\]

The matrix \(V\) is positive definite. Suppose \(\sum_a c_aU_a=0\) almost surely. Continuity and Gaussian full support imply, for every \(s\in\mathbb R^m\),
\[
\left(\sum_a y_a\phi^{(2)}(s_a)\right)
\left(\sum_a c_a(\phi^{(2)})'(s_a)\right)=0.
\tag{5}
\]
Where the first factor is nonzero, the second is zero. If the first factor is zero and some \((\phi^{(2)})'(s_a)\ne0\), its corresponding partial derivative \(y_a(\phi^{(2)})'(s_a)\) is nonzero; arbitrarily close points have a nonzero first factor, so continuity again makes the second factor zero. If all activation derivatives at that point vanish, the second factor is already zero. Consequently
\[
\sum_a c_a(\phi^{(2)})'(s_a)=0
\qquad\text{for every }s.
\]
The derivative \((\phi^{(2)})'\) is nonconstant, because a bounded nonconstant activation cannot have constant derivative. Varying one coordinate forces each \(c_a=0\). No division by \(S\) was used: \(S\) is allowed to vanish on a set of positive probability.

For the broader conditional class, boundedness of \(\phi^{(2)}\) can be replaced here by nonaffinity and a bounded continuous derivative. The derivative remains nonconstant, and all the necessary moments exist because \(\phi^{(2)}\) has at most linear growth on the Gaussian input.

Conditioning the initial Gaussian matrix on its initial forward calls gives
\[
P_a
=
\sum_c H_{0,c}^{(1)}
\left[Q^{-1}\mathbb E[YU_a]\right]_c
+\Gamma_a,
\qquad
\Gamma\sim N(0,\sigma_2^2V),
\tag{6}
\]
where \(\Gamma\) is independent of the first-layer roots. This is the reused-transpose response, not a replacement of the transpose by an independent matrix. The deterministic response in (6) retains the information from the initial forward uses.

For any deterministic \(c\ne0\), the conditional Gaussian covariance gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb E\left[\left(\sum_a c_aB_a\right)^2\right]
&\ge
\sigma_2^2\lambda_{\min}(V)
\sum_a c_a^2
\mathbb E[((\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,a}^{(1)}))^2]\\
&>0.
\end{aligned}\tag{7}
\]
Each final expectation is positive: a continuously differentiable nonconstant function has a nonzero derivative on an interval, and every first-layer Gaussian marginal has full support. Therefore \(D\succ0\), even if the derivative is zero on large sets or changes sign.

#### Each input moves in both hidden layers

Set
\[
T_a=\sum_bG_{ab}y_bB_b,
\qquad
M_a=\sum_b y_bQ_{ab}U_b,
\]
\[
A_a=(\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,a}^{(1)})T_a,
\qquad
R_a^\kappa
=\kappa_2M_a+\kappa_1W_0^{(2)}A_a.
\tag{8}
\]
Each \(T_a\) is nonzero in mean square. Its coefficient vector against \(B\) has \(a\)-th entry \(G_{aa}y_a=y_a\ne0\), and \(D\succ0\).

Each \(R_a^\kappa\) is also nonzero, but this requires more than positivity of an aggregate sum. Subtract the mean-square projection of \(A_a\) onto \(\operatorname{span}\{H_{0,b}^{(1)}\}\):
\[
\alpha_a=Q^{-1}\mathbb E[H_0^{(1)}A_a],
\qquad
A_a^\perp
=A_a-\sum_b\alpha_{a,b}H_{0,b}^{(1)}.
\tag{9}
\]
Conditional on the first-layer roots, \(A_a\) is linear in \(\Gamma\) with coefficients
\[
c_b
=(\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,a}^{(1)})
G_{ab}y_b
(\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,b}^{(1)}).
\]
Its \(a\)-th coefficient is
\[
c_a=y_a((\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,a}^{(1)}))^2,
\]
which is nonzero with positive probability. Since \(V\succ0\),
\[
\mathbb E[(A_a^\perp)^2]
\ge
\mathbb E\operatorname{Var}(A_a\mid Z_0^{(1)})
=\sigma_2^2\mathbb E[c^\top Vc]>0.
\tag{10}
\]

Conditioning the same initial matrix on both sets of known calls,
\[
W_0^{(2)}H_{0,b}^{(1)}=Y_b,
\qquad
(W_0^{(2)})^*U_b=P_b,
\]
gives the next forward response
\[
W_0^{(2)}A_a
=
\sum_b\alpha_{a,b}Y_b
+\sum_b\beta_{a,b}U_b
+\sigma_2\sqrt{\mathbb E[(A_a^\perp)^2]}\,\gamma_a,
\qquad
\beta_a=V^{-1}\mathbb E[PA_a^\perp].
\tag{11}
\]
Here \(\gamma_a\) is standard Gaussian independent of the previous second-layer coordinates. The formula is the finite Gaussian conditional mean plus the unused matrix randomness: the input component in (9) has the displayed squared norm, while projection of the fresh output off finitely many previous output directions disappears in normalized mean square. Positive definiteness of \(Q,V\) justifies both inverses. A separate marginal calculation for each \(a\) is sufficient; independence between the different \(\gamma_a\) is not claimed.

The term \(M_a\) depends only on \(Y\), and hence cannot cancel this independent Gaussian component. Therefore
\[
\mathbb E[(R_a^\kappa)^2]
\ge
\kappa_1^2\sigma_2^2\mathbb E[(A_a^\perp)^2]
>0.
\tag{12}
\]
The learned-matrix contribution \(M_a\) is separately nonzero: its coefficient vector \((y_bQ_{ab})_b\) against \(U\) has nonzero \(a\)-th entry \(y_aQ_{aa}\), and \(V\succ0\).

At initialization \(r_a(0)=-y_a\) and \(W^{(3)}(0)=0\). Dividing the integral equations by the indicated powers of \(t\) gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
W^{(3)}(t)&=2\kappa_3tS+o_{L^2}(t),\\
\delta_a^{(2)}(t)&=2\kappa_3tU_a+o_{L^2}(t),\\
Z_a^{(1)}(t)-Z_{0,a}^{(1)}
&=2\kappa_1\kappa_3t^2T_a+o_{L^2}(t^2),\\
W^{(2)}(t)-W_0^{(2)}
&=2\kappa_2\kappa_3t^2
\sum_b y_bU_b\otimes H_{0,b}^{(1)}+o_{\mathrm{op}}(t^2),\\
Z_a^{(2)}(t)-Y_a
&=2\kappa_3t^2R_a^\kappa+o_{L^2}(t^2).
\end{aligned}\tag{13}
\]
For example the readout equation first gives its \(t\)-coefficient. Multiplication by the bounded continuous derivative gives the backward \(t\)-coefficient. The first-layer and middle-matrix integrals then start at order \(t^2\). In the last equation, the learned-matrix term is \(\kappa_2M_a\), while the moving first activation gives \(\kappa_1W_0^{(2)}A_a\). Bounded derivatives justify these activation difference quotients by dominated convergence along mean-square converging increments.

Direct substitution in (1) also gives
\[
\frac{\dot Z_a^{(1)}(t)}t
\longrightarrow 4\kappa_1\kappa_3T_a,
\qquad
\frac{\dot Z_a^{(2)}(t)}t
\longrightarrow 4\kappa_3R_a^\kappa
\quad\text{in }L^2.
\tag{14}
\]
Thus every hidden RMS speed is bounded above and below by positive constants times \(t\), on a fixed sufficiently short interval. For the first layer,
\[
\mathbb E[(Z_a^{(1)}(t)-Z_{0,a}^{(1)})^2]
=4\kappa_1^2\kappa_3^2\mathbb E[T_a^2]t^4+o(t^4),
\]
\[
\int_0^t\mathbb E[|\dot Z_a^{(1)}(s)|^2]\,ds
=\frac{16}{3}\kappa_1^2\kappa_3^2\mathbb E[T_a^2]t^3+o(t^3).
\tag{15}
\]
For the second layer replace \(\kappa_1^2\mathbb E[T_a^2]\) by \(\mathbb E[(R_a^\kappa)^2]\). In particular the speed is zero initially, not bounded below by a positive constant as \(t\downarrow0\). It is nonzero at every fixed positive time in the asserted interval.

#### The kernel, loss, and surviving nonlinearity

The physical kernel is \(K=\kappa_1K^{(1)}+\kappa_2K^{(2)}+\kappa_3K^{(3)}\), with
\[
K_{ab}^{(1)}=G_{ab}\mathbb E[\delta_a^{(1)}\delta_b^{(1)}],
\]
\[
K_{ab}^{(2)}
=\mathbb E[H_a^{(1)}H_b^{(1)}]
\mathbb E[\delta_a^{(2)}\delta_b^{(2)}],
\qquad
K_{ab}^{(3)}=\mathbb E[H_a^{(2)}H_b^{(2)}].
\tag{16}
\]
Let \(\circ\) denote entrywise matrix multiplication. Although \(G\) may be singular, \(G\circ D\) is positive definite. Decompose \(G=\sum_j v_jv_j^\top\). Then
\[
G\circ D
=\sum_j\operatorname{diag}(v_j)D\operatorname{diag}(v_j)
\succeq
\lambda_{\min}(D)\operatorname{diag}(G_{11},\ldots,G_{mm})
=\lambda_{\min}(D)I.
\tag{17}
\]
The same argument makes \(Q\circ V\) positive definite, since its diagonal entries \(Q_{aa}\) are positive. Define
\[
A_1=y^\top(G\circ D)y>0,
\qquad
A_2=y^\top(Q\circ V)y>0.
\tag{18}
\]
Adjunction yields
\[
\sum_a y_a\mathbb E[U_aR_a^\kappa]
=\kappa_1A_1+\kappa_2A_2.
\tag{19}
\]
The kernel expansions are therefore
\[
\begin{aligned}
\kappa_1K^{(1)}(t)
&=4\kappa_1\kappa_3^2t^2(G\circ D)+o(t^2),\\
\kappa_2K^{(2)}(t)
&=4\kappa_2\kappa_3^2t^2(Q\circ V)+o(t^2),\\
y^\top K^{(3)}(t)y
&=\mathbb E[S^2]
+4\kappa_3(\kappa_1A_1+\kappa_2A_2)t^2+o(t^2),\\
y^\top K(t)y
&=\kappa_3\mathbb E[S^2]
+8\kappa_3^2(\kappa_1A_1+\kappa_2A_2)t^2+o(t^2).
\end{aligned}\tag{20}
\]
The initial readout block is positive definite: a linear dependence among \(\phi^{(2)}(Y_a)\) would hold for all \(Y\) by full support, and varying one coordinate forces its coefficient to zero. All three blocks are therefore positive definite for sufficiently small positive time. The first two start at zero with positive definite \(t^2\) coefficients, and the third increases in the label direction. Each block, and the total kernel, is nonconstant.

The summed loss satisfies
\[
L(0)=\sum_a y_a^2,
\qquad
-\dot L(0)=4\kappa_3\mathbb E[S^2]>0.
\]
Continuity allows the time interval to be shortened so that
\[
-\dot L(t)\ge2\kappa_3\mathbb E[S^2]>0
\qquad(0\le t\le T_*).
\tag{21}
\]
This does not assert that every individual residual magnitude decreases.

Every initial hidden marginal is a nondegenerate Gaussian. A bounded nonconstant continuous activation cannot agree with an affine function on its full support. Thus the best-affine-fit error
\[
\inf_{\alpha,\beta}
\mathbb E[(\phi^{(\ell)}(Z)-\alpha Z-\beta)^2]
=
\operatorname{Var}(\phi^{(\ell)}(Z))
-\frac{\operatorname{Cov}(Z,\phi^{(\ell)}(Z))^2}
{\operatorname{Var}(Z)}
\tag{22}
\]
is initially positive. The same is true for the broader nonaffine activation class. Bounded derivatives make both activations globally Lipschitz, so these moments vary continuously along the mean-square continuous paths. All \(2m\) variances and all \(2m\) affine-fit errors retain common positive lower bounds on a possibly shorter \([0,T_*]\).

#### Sufficient checks beyond the simple activation class

The positivity argument uses the following concrete sufficient conditions, rather than monotonicity or analyticity:

1. The initial first-activation Gram matrix \(Q\) is positive definite.
2. On the full-support second-layer Gaussian tuple, the Gram matrix \(V\) of \(U_a=S(\phi^{(2)})'(Y_a)\) is positive definite.
3. For every input, \(\mathbb E[((\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,a}^{(1)}))^2]>0\).
4. For the separate nonlinear-fit conclusion, each activation is nonaffine on its initial Gaussian support.

These checks are sufficient, not necessary. In conjunction with bounded continuous derivatives and the assumed strong flow, they yield the calculations above. The bounded nonconstant activation class guarantees all of them automatically for pairwise nonparallel inputs and nonzero labels. More broadly, both activations may be unbounded but nonaffine with bounded continuous derivatives: the differentiated ridge argument proves the first check, the proof of (5) proves the second, and Gaussian initialization plus linear growth supplies the required initial moments. This broader statement concerns strict activity conditional on existence; it must not be used to enlarge an independently proved existence theorem without checking that theorem's hypotheses.

Some excluded cases show why nondegeneracy matters. Identical inputs with opposite labels can give \(S=0\) identically and a frozen zero-readout system. Antiparallel inputs with odd activations and equal labels can do the same. A constant first activation has zero first-layer derivative; a constant second activation has zero backward derivative. An affine first activation can make \(Q\) singular when there are more inputs than their linear span dimension. An affine second activation has identical derivative functions, so \(V\) has rank at most one for \(m>1\). Such cases can still have some learning, but the full collection of strict conclusions above is not automatic. Finally, allowing a zero label can invalidate the per-input initial activity assertion, for example for an orthogonal input decoupled from the other labeled inputs.


#### Weighted-loss activity and the exact kernel direction

For the weighted loss in C.1, \(\mathcal L=\sum_a\omega_a(f_a-y_a)^2\), put \(p_a=\omega_a y_a\) in this paragraph. Retain every hypothesis of C.3, including Gaussian first weights, zero population readout and nonzero labels. The unweighted kernel blocks in C.3 are unchanged, and
\[
 \dot f_a=-2\sum_bK_{ab}\omega_b r_b,\qquad
 \dot{\mathcal L}=-4\sum_{a,b}\omega_a r_aK_{ab}\omega_b r_b.
\]
In C.3's definitions of S,U,B,T,M,A and R, and its onset expansions, replace each training label y_b by p_b. Then, with \(D_{ab}=E[B_aB_b]\), \(V_{ab}=E[U_aU_b]\),
\[
 A_1=p^\top(G\circ D)p>0,\qquad A_2=p^\top(Q\circ V)p>0,
\]
\[
 p^\top K(t)p=\kappa_3 ES^2+
 8\kappa_3^2(\kappa_1A_1+\kappa_2A_2)t^2+o(t^2),
 \qquad-\dot{\mathcal L}(0)=4\kappa_3 ES^2>0.
\]
This substitution is justified directly in the raw equations: the factor at initialization is \(-\omega_b r_b(0)=\omega_b y_b\); every first nonzero hidden term is obtained by integrating that factor against the first readout term. All positive-definiteness arguments only require the corresponding p_a to be nonzero, which follows from positive weights and nonzero labels. In the upper-layer acceleration the learned term is a function of the original upper forward tuple, while the forward image of the lower-layer increment has an independent Gaussian component of positive variance. Multiplying by the upper activation derivative preserves a positive squared norm because that derivative is nonzero with positive Gaussian probability. Thus every sample's activation, as well as its preactivation, has nonzero order-t^2 displacement and order-t speed. The quadratic kernel direction is p, not y, for this weighted statement. No initialization variance is inserted in the trained rank-one terms.
