# A global population limit for general activations

For one input, or finitely many mutually orthogonal inputs, the arctangent proof extends to a broad activation class on **every fixed finite time interval**. The first activation can even have derivative zeros or change monotonicity. The proof below does not establish a global-time nonlinear theorem for arbitrary correlated inputs. An affine-first-layer exception is stated separately, and the strict feature-learning conclusions remain short-time conclusions.

## The theorem and the network

Fix \(m<\infty\) inputs \(x_a\in\mathbb R^d\) satisfying
\[
\frac{x_a^\top x_b}{d}=\mathbf 1_{\{a=b\}},
\qquad 1\le a,b\le m.
\]
Fix labels \(y_a\in\mathbb R\) and positive constants \(\kappa_1,\kappa_2,\kappa_3\), independent of width and step size. Allow different activations in the two hidden layers:

- \(\phi^{(1)}\) is continuously differentiable, and \((\phi^{(1)})'\) is bounded and globally Lipschitz. The activation itself need not be bounded, monotone, or odd.
- \(\phi^{(2)}\) is bounded and continuously differentiable, and \((\phi^{(2)})'\) is bounded and globally Lipschitz.

The dimensions are \(W^{(1)}\in\mathbb R^{n\times d}\), \(W^{(2)}\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}\), and \(W^{(3)}\in\mathbb R^n\). The readout \(W^{(3)}\) is the rescaled readout throughout. Define
\[
\begin{aligned}
z_a^{(1)}&=\frac{W^{(1)}x_a}{\sqrt d},
&
h_a^{(1)}&=\phi^{(1)}(z_a^{(1)}),\\
z_a^{(2)}&=W^{(2)}h_a^{(1)},
&
h_a^{(2)}&=\phi^{(2)}(z_a^{(2)}),\\
f_{n,a}&=\frac{(W^{(3)})^\top h_a^{(2)}}{n},
&
r_{n,a}&=f_{n,a}-y_a,
\qquad L_n=\sum_{a=1}^m r_{n,a}^2.
\end{aligned}
\]
The residual-free backpropagated derivatives are
\[
\delta_a^{(2)}
=
W^{(3)}\odot(\phi^{(2)})'(z_a^{(2)}),
\qquad
\delta_a^{(1)}
=
(\phi^{(1)})'(z_a^{(1)})
\odot(W^{(2)})^\top\delta_a^{(2)}.
\]
Thus \(\delta_a^{(\ell)}=n\,\partial f_{n,a}/\partial z_a^{(\ell)}\). The exact updates are
\[
\begin{aligned}
z_{a,k+1}^{(1)}
&=
z_{a,k}^{(1)}
-2\kappa_1\eta_n r_{n,a,k}\delta_{a,k}^{(1)},\\
W_{k+1}^{(2)}
&=
W_k^{(2)}
-\frac{2\kappa_2\eta_n}{n}
\sum_{a=1}^m
r_{n,a,k}\delta_{a,k}^{(2)}(h_{a,k}^{(1)})^\top,\\
W_{k+1}^{(3)}
&=
W_k^{(3)}
-2\kappa_3\eta_n
\sum_{a=1}^m r_{n,a,k}h_{a,k}^{(2)}.
\end{aligned} \tag{1}
\]
The first equation uses orthogonality. In the original first weights, it follows from
\[
W_{k+1}^{(1)}
=
W_k^{(1)}
-\frac{2\kappa_1\eta_n}{\sqrt d}
\sum_{a=1}^m r_{n,a,k}\delta_{a,k}^{(1)}x_a^\top.
\]

Initialize independently by
\[
W_{0,ij}^{(1)}\sim N(0,\sigma_1^2),
\qquad
W_{0,ji}^{(2)}\sim N(0,\sigma_2^2/n),
\]
where the variances are fixed and finite. The following readout initializations are allowed:

- A vanishing Gaussian readout
  \[
  W_{0,j}^{(3)}\sim N(0,\sigma_3^2n^{-2\beta}),
  \qquad \beta>0.
  \]
  Here \(\beta\) describes the decay of the standard deviation. Gaussian tail bounds give
  \[
  \|W_0^{(3)}\|_\infty
  =
  O_{\mathbb P}(n^{-\beta}\sqrt{\log n})
  \longrightarrow0.
  \]
  The original initialization has \(\beta=1\).
- More generally, an independent readout whose coordinate supremum tends to zero in probability. Its population initialization is zero.
- A fixed bounded readout law: the coordinates are iid with a law supported on \([-B_0,B_0]\), independently of the other initialization. The population starts from that law. A perturbation whose coordinate supremum tends to zero may also be added, giving a finite initial supremum at most \(B_0+o_{\mathbb P}(1)\).

An arbitrary bounded law can be generated as a bounded measurable function of an additional independent Gaussian root. The bounded nonvanishing option does **not** include an untruncated \(O(1)\) Gaussian readout: that initialization lacks the population supremum bound used in this proof.

For every fixed \(T<\infty\), the population equations have a unique autonomous gradient-flow solution on \([0,T]\). For every sequence
\[
\eta_n>0,
\qquad
\eta_n\sqrt n\longrightarrow0,
\]
the exact GD trajectories on the clock \(t=k\eta_n\) converge to that solution. Interpolate the finite parameters linearly and recompute the forward pass between steps.

The conclusion includes predictions, summed loss, all kernel-block entries, same-layer joint hidden path laws with their second moments, and fixed finite collections of continuous globally Lipschitz forward/adjoint measurements. Products in these measurement constructions must have bounded varying factors; the unbounded backward fields and their quadratic measurements are included through the tail argument below. Integrated squared hidden speeds converge as well. Convergence is in probability, uniformly in time for the stated pointwise measurements. No claim about arbitrary higher-growth measurements is needed.

The step condition is sufficient, not claimed necessary. These activation assumptions alone do not force nonlinearity or motion: they intentionally include a constant or affine first activation. Additional assumptions for strict feature learning appear at the end.

## A scalar coordinate that removes the first-layer gate

Let \(J(s,z)\) solve
\[
\frac{\partial J(s,z)}{\partial s}
=
(\phi^{(1)})'(J(s,z)),
\qquad
J(0,z)=z,
\qquad s\in\mathbb R.
\tag{2}
\]
Write
\[
M_1=\|(\phi^{(1)})'\|_\infty,
\qquad
L_1=\operatorname{Lip}((\phi^{(1)})').
\]
The bounded Lipschitz scalar vector field has a unique global solution in both time directions. Integration and the scalar difference inequality give
\[
|J(s,z)-J(t,z)|\le M_1|s-t|,
\qquad
|J(s,z)|\le |z|+M_1|s|,
\tag{3}
\]
\[
|J(s,z)-J(s,w)|
\le e^{L_1|s|}|z-w|.
\]
In particular, \(J\) is jointly continuous. Uniqueness gives the flow identity
\[
J(s,J(t,z))=J(s+t,z),
\]
because both sides solve the same scalar equation as functions of \(s\), with the same value at \(s=0\). Also,
\[
|\phi^{(1)}(J(s,z))-\phi^{(1)}(J(t,z))|
\le M_1^2|s-t|. \tag{4}
\]

For each input introduce a clock displacement \(X_a^{(1)}(0)=0\), keeping the fixed Gaussian root \(Z_{0,a}^{(1)}\), and set
\[
Z_a^{(1)}(t)
=
J(X_a^{(1)}(t),Z_{0,a}^{(1)}).
\tag{5}
\]
The population network is
\[
\begin{aligned}
H_a^{(1)}&=\phi^{(1)}(Z_a^{(1)}),
&
Z_a^{(2)}&=W^{(2)}H_a^{(1)},\\
H_a^{(2)}&=\phi^{(2)}(Z_a^{(2)}),
&
f_a&=\mathbb E[W^{(3)}H_a^{(2)}],
\qquad r_a=f_a-y_a,\\
\delta_a^{(2)}
&=
W^{(3)}(\phi^{(2)})'(Z_a^{(2)}),
&
\delta_a^{(1)}
&=
(\phi^{(1)})'(Z_a^{(1)})
(W^{(2)})^*\delta_a^{(2)}.
\end{aligned}
\]
Its transformed equations are
\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot X_a^{(1)}
&=-2\kappa_1 r_a(W^{(2)})^*\delta_a^{(2)},\\
\dot W^{(2)}
&=-2\kappa_2\sum_{a=1}^m
r_a\delta_a^{(2)}\otimes H_a^{(1)},\\
\dot W^{(3)}
&=-2\kappa_3\sum_{a=1}^m r_aH_a^{(2)}.
\end{aligned} \tag{6}
\]
Here the rank-one action is explicitly
\[
(u\otimes v)V=u\,\mathbb E[vV].
\]
Every expectation pairs coordinates of the same layer. The first-layer and second-layer populations are separate.

The initial \(W_0^{(2)}\) is the bounded forward-and-adjoint action obtained from the joint limits of finite Gaussian matrix calculations, as described below. It is **not** an ordinary continuum matrix or integral kernel with iid Gaussian entries. The notation records its action on generated population fields, together with its adjoint.

The scalar chain rule converts (6) into the ordinary first-layer equation
\[
\dot Z_a^{(1)}=-2\kappa_1 r_a\delta_a^{(1)}.
\tag{7}
\]
Conversely, any solution of (7) in the bounded state class used below has representation (5). Indeed, Cauchy–Schwarz and Fubini make its backward coefficient integrable in time at almost every coordinate. For an integrable scalar coefficient \(b(t)\), the equation
\[
\dot z(t)=b(t)(\phi^{(1)})'(z(t))
\]
has the solution
\[
z(t)=J\!\left(\int_0^t b(s)\,ds,z(0)\right).
\]
Differentiation verifies the equation, and the Lipschitz difference inequality with integrable coefficient \(|b(t)|L_1\) proves uniqueness. Thus the scalar coordinate changes neither the original gradient flow nor its possible solutions.

When \((\phi^{(1)})'>0\), one can use
\[
F'(z)=\frac1{(\phi^{(1)})'(z)},
\qquad
J(s,z)=F^{-1}(F(z)+s).
\]
But the displacement formulation does not require
\(\mathbb E[F(Z_0^{(1)})^2]<\infty\). The rapid growth of this integral for an erf activation therefore places no restriction on its Gaussian initialization variance.

## Global existence, uniqueness, and autonomy

For a population variable \(U\), write
\[
\|U\|_{L^2}:=\sqrt{\mathbb E[U^2]}.
\]
The operator norm is its largest amplification of this root-mean-square size. Compare two states with the same fixed first-layer roots using
\[
\begin{aligned}
d={}&
\sum_{a=1}^m
\|X_a^{(1)}-\widetilde X_a^{(1)}\|_{L^2}\\
&+\|W^{(2)}-\widetilde W^{(2)}\|_{\mathrm{op}}
+\|W^{(3)}-\widetilde W^{(3)}\|_{L^2}.
\end{aligned} \tag{8}
\]
At finite width replace every population \(L^2\) norm by the ordinary Euclidean norm divided by \(\sqrt n\); denote this distance by \(d_n\).

On sets with bounded clock \(L^2\) norms, matrix operator norms, and readout suprema, the transformed vector field is Lipschitz in (8), with a constant independent of width. The key bounds are as follows. Equation (4) controls first-activation differences, and
\[
\|H_a^{(1)}\|_{L^2}
\le
|\phi^{(1)}(0)|
+M_1\|Z_{0,a}^{(1)}\|_{L^2}
+M_1^2\|X_a^{(1)}\|_{L^2}.
\tag{9}
\]
Adding and subtracting one factor bounds the forward matrix difference. The second-layer backward difference satisfies
\[
\begin{aligned}
\|\delta_a^{(2)}-\widetilde\delta_a^{(2)}\|_{L^2}
\le{}&
\|(\phi^{(2)})'\|_\infty
\|W^{(3)}-\widetilde W^{(3)}\|_{L^2}\\
&+
\|\widetilde W^{(3)}\|_\infty
\operatorname{Lip}((\phi^{(2)})')
\|Z_a^{(2)}-\widetilde Z_a^{(2)}\|_{L^2}.
\end{aligned}
\tag{10}
\]
Its adjoint response is Lipschitz by the operator bound. The output uses boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of \(\phi^{(2)}\). Finally,
\[
\|u\otimes v-\widetilde u\otimes\widetilde v\|_{\mathrm{op}}
\le
\|u-\widetilde u\|_{L^2}\|v\|_{L^2}
+
\|\widetilde u\|_{L^2}\|v-\widetilde v\|_{L^2}.
\]
These estimates prove local existence and uniqueness by contracting the integrated equations on a short interval. A common readout supremum bound defines a closed complete set under (8), and its integral update preserves that bound after the interval is made short enough.

The chain rule and the adjoint identity give
\[
\dot f=-2Kr,
\qquad
\dot L=-4r^\top Kr\le0,
\tag{11}
\]
where
\[
K=\kappa_1K^{(1)}+\kappa_2K^{(2)}+\kappa_3K^{(3)}
\]
and
\[
\begin{aligned}
K_{ab}^{(1)}
&=\mathbf1_{\{a=b\}}\,
\mathbb E[\delta_a^{(1)}\delta_b^{(1)}],\\
K_{ab}^{(2)}
&=\mathbb E[H_a^{(1)}H_b^{(1)}]\,
  \mathbb E[\delta_a^{(2)}\delta_b^{(2)}],\\
K_{ab}^{(3)}
&=\mathbb E[H_a^{(2)}H_b^{(2)}].
\end{aligned}
\tag{12}
\]
Each block is the Gram matrix of the corresponding parameter gradients. Thus \(\|r(t)\|_2\le\|r(0)\|_2\).

Let \(B_2=\|\phi^{(2)}\|_\infty\). The readout equation yields
\[
\|W^{(3)}(t)\|_\infty
\le
\|W^{(3)}(0)\|_\infty
+
2\kappa_3B_2\sqrt m\,\|r(0)\|_2t.
\tag{13}
\]
On any prescribed finite horizon \(T\), this bounds every \(\delta_a^{(2)}\), both in mean square and in supremum. Equations (6) and (9) then give
\[
\|\dot X_a^{(1)}\|_{L^2}
\le C_T\|W^{(2)}\|_{\mathrm{op}},
\qquad
\|\dot W^{(2)}\|_{\mathrm{op}}
\le C_T\left(1+\sum_a\|X_a^{(1)}\|_{L^2}\right).
\tag{14}
\]
The fixed initial root norms are absorbed into \(C_T\). Adding and integrating these inequalities gives a linear Gronwall bound on the clock norms and matrix operator norm throughout \([0,T]\). No finite-time blow-up or loss of the bounded-state conditions is possible. The solution therefore extends uniquely to every finite horizon.

The original state is autonomous as well. At a restart time, take the current \(Z_a^{(1)}\) as the new roots in (5), set the new clocks to zero, and repeat the same argument. The original equations require only current fields and the current matrix action and adjoint. More formally, the closed spaces generated from current fields by the bounded coordinate operations and these actions contain the future integral construction. Equal current joint action laws give an isometry of these spaces that preserves the equations. Uniqueness then gives equal future action laws. Earlier clock values and the original initialization are not additional information needed for the future.

## Identifying the population action and passing to the width limit

We use the fixed-program specialization of Setup 2.2 and Theorem 2.10 of [Tensor Programs III](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10685). For a fixed finite calculation with iid jointly Gaussian initial coordinate tuples, independent Gaussian matrices of variance \(\sigma_2^2/n\), and polynomially bounded coordinate instructions, fixed same-layer polynomially bounded empirical measurements converge to their prescribed population expectations. The limit retains the responses from reused transpose calls. This theorem is applied only to fixed programs, never to a program whose length grows with width.

Its hypotheses hold here. The initial preactivations form a Gaussian tuple; an independent Gaussian root can generate a bounded readout law. Equations (3)–(4) make \(J(X,Z_0)\) and \(\phi^{(1)}(J(X,Z_0))\) linearly bounded. The other activation and derivative maps are bounded. The backward products have polynomial growth. At fixed mesh, the rank expansion makes finitely many matrix and transpose calls, with deterministic population residuals and contractions. Vanishing initialization perturbations are transferred separately by stability, not inserted as width-dependent coordinate functions.

For clarity, the common initial action is constructed before solving the flow. Collect the finite calculations for rational meshes, their finite unions, and a countable closure under the coordinate operations and bounded continuous measurements used here. The fixed-program theorem gives consistent finite joint laws, realized on one coordinate space for each layer. Exact finite linear identities pass to these laws. A Gaussian matrix operator bound implies, with a fixed sufficiently large \(M\),
\[
\|W_0^{(2)}V\|_{L^2}
\le M\|V\|_{L^2}
\]
for every generated \(V\); the same holds for the transpose action. For example the finite bound follows from two \(1/4\)-nets and a union bound,
\[
\mathbb P\!\left(\|W_0^{(2)}\|_{\mathrm{op}}>M\right)
\le
2\,9^{2n}
\exp\!\left(-\frac{nM^2}{8\sigma_2^2}\right)
\longrightarrow0
\]
when \(\sigma_2>0\); the action is zero when \(\sigma_2=0\).
Hence the actions are well-defined on variables equal in mean square and extend to the closures of the generated spans. The finite transpose identity passes to
\[
\mathbb E[U\,W_0^{(2)}V]
=
\mathbb E[((W_0^{(2)})^*U)V].
\tag{15}
\]
This identifies the forward and backward actions as adjoints on the same two fixed spaces. It is the initial object used in (6).

For a proof mesh \(\Delta\), Euler applied to (6) has error \(O_T(\Delta)\), uniformly in width and also in the population space. The bounded vector field and its Lipschitz constant give a one-step error \(C_T\Delta^2\), so
\[
e_{k+1}\le(1+C_T\Delta)e_k+C_T\Delta^2.
\]
Summation gives the stated error. A first-exit argument keeps the clock and matrix inside slightly larger bounds; the readout supremum is controlled separately by its update, as in (13).

At fixed \(\Delta\), expand the trained matrix as its initialization plus finitely many rank-one updates. Construct the oracle using the population residuals and every population contraction in those expansions. The fixed-program theorem identifies all its joint node laws and quadratic contractions. Applying its proxy matrix to an oracle vector differs from the prescribed node by finitely many terms of the form
\[
-2\kappa_2\Delta r_{b,s}\,
\delta_{b,s,\mathrm{oracle}}^{(2)}
\left[
\frac{
(h_{b,s,\mathrm{oracle}}^{(1)})^\top
h_{a,k,\mathrm{oracle}}^{(1)}
}{n}
-
\mathbb E[H_{b,s}^{(1)}H_{a,k}^{(1)}]
\right].
\tag{16}
\]
Each scalar discrepancy vanishes and each vector has bounded root-mean-square norm. The corresponding transpose discrepancies use contractions of two second-layer backward fields. Thus recomputed proxy quantities approach the oracle nodes.

The state estimate (8) transfers this identification to finite Euler with empirical feedback. All factors involving the readout can be clipped beyond its proven supremum bound without changing any oracle value. For comparisons the roots stay fixed: \(J\) and its first activation are uniformly Lipschitz in their changing clock arguments. A joint global Lipschitz bound in the frozen root is neither asserted nor needed.

Consequently, taking \(n\to\infty\) at fixed \(\Delta\), and then \(\Delta\to0\), proves the population limit of the finite continuous flow on every \([0,T]\).

## The bridge from exact GD

A scalar estimate makes the discrete argument work even when the first derivative vanishes or changes sign. In the following calculation only, write
\[
A=(\phi^{(1)})',
\qquad L=\operatorname{Lip}(A),
\qquad
z^+=z+\eta A(z)b.
\]
If \(L\eta|b|\le1/2\) and \(A(z)\ne0\), then for \(0\le s\le1\),
\[
|A(z+s\eta A(z)b)-A(z)|
\le L\eta|A(z)b|
\le \frac{|A(z)|}{2}.
\]
The whole segment stays in the same interval where \(A\ne0\). Define its exact scalar-flow clock increment by
\[
\Delta X=\int_z^{z^+}\frac{du}{A(u)}.
\]
Then \(z^+=J(\Delta X,z)\). Substitution in the integral gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
|\Delta X-\eta b|
&\le
\eta|b|\int_0^1
\left|
\frac{A(z)}{A(z+s\eta A(z)b)}-1
\right|\,ds\\
&\le L\eta^2b^2.
\end{aligned} \tag{17}
\]
If \(A(z)=0\), the raw step fixes \(z\). Set \(\Delta X=\eta b\); the same exact representation holds because \(J(s,z)=z\) at an equilibrium. If \(L=0\), the derivative is constant and there is no coordinate defect or step restriction.

Apply (17) to each coordinate with
\[
b_a
=
-2\kappa_1r_{n,a}
(W^{(2)})^\top\delta_a^{(2)}.
\tag{18}
\]
The raw GD trajectories themselves have width-independent bounds on \([0,T]\). First,
\[
|r_{n,a}|
\le |y_a|+B_2\|W^{(3)}\|_\infty
\]
and the readout update give a discrete Gronwall bound on its supremum. This bounds \(\delta_a^{(2)}\). The first raw update then has root-mean-square increment at most \(C_T\eta_n\|W^{(2)}\|_{\mathrm{op}}\), while the matrix operator increment is at most
\[
C_T\eta_n
\left(
1+\sum_a\frac{\|z_a^{(1)}\|_2}{\sqrt n}
\right).
\]
Adding these bounds gives a second discrete linear Gronwall estimate. The initial root RMS and matrix operator norm are bounded with probability tending to one, and the allowed readout initializations have the requisite high-probability uniform supremum bound. On these events,
\[
\frac{\|b_a\|_2}{\sqrt n}\le C_T,
\qquad
\|b_a\|_\infty\le C_T\sqrt n.
\tag{19}
\]
Thus \(\eta_n\sqrt n\to0\) enforces the scalar step condition throughout the interval.

Lift the raw iterates recursively by these exact clock increments, starting from \(x_{a,0}^{(1)}=0\). The scalar flow identity ensures
\[
z_{a,k}^{(1)}
=
J(x_{a,k}^{(1)},z_{a,0}^{(1)})
\]
exactly at every step. The lifted first update differs from transformed Euler by at most
\[
\begin{aligned}
L\eta_n^2
\left(\frac1n\sum_i b_{a,i}^4\right)^{1/2}
&\le
L\eta_n^2\|b_a\|_\infty
\frac{\|b_a\|_2}{\sqrt n}\\
&\le C_T\eta_n^2\sqrt n
\end{aligned}
\tag{20}
\]
in root-mean-square norm.

It is important that the clocks themselves stay in the common Lipschitz region, including when \(J\) has equilibria and cannot be inverted. Summing their exact increments gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\|x_{a,k}^{(1)}\|_2}{\sqrt n}
&\le
\sum_{j<k}
\left[
\eta_n\frac{\|b_{a,j}\|_2}{\sqrt n}
+
L\eta_n^2\|b_{a,j}\|_\infty
\frac{\|b_{a,j}\|_2}{\sqrt n}
\right]\\
&\le C_T(1+\eta_n\sqrt n),
\qquad k\eta_n\le T.
\end{aligned}
\tag{21}
\]
Thus the transformed stability constant remains width-independent.

The other parameter updates are already Euler updates for (6). Add their ordinary \(O_T(\eta_n^2)\) local flow error and sum the stable recurrence:
\[
\sup_{t\le T}
d_n\!\left(
\text{lifted GD}(t),\text{finite flow}(t)
\right)
\le
C_T(\eta_n+\eta_n\sqrt n).
\tag{22}
\]
At interpolation times, the scalar flow segment and the linear raw segment differ by the same vanishing bound; the state movement inside one step is \(O_T(\eta_n)\). This proves the raw GD bridge without a moment assumption on an unshifted scalar transform.

Combining (22), the fixed-mesh oracle limit, and the two \(O_T(\Delta)\) mesh errors proves the joint width/step conclusion.

For the remaining quadratic measurements, the backward fields
\[
(W^{(2)}(t))^*\delta_a^{(2)}(t)
\]
form a compact time-indexed family in \(L^2\). Their squared tails therefore vanish uniformly as the clipping threshold grows. Clip before multiplying by \((\phi^{(1)})'(Z_a^{(1)})\), pass the resulting bounded Lipschitz measurements through the proved limit, and remove clipping. Fixed-grid second-moment convergence and state continuity give the corresponding finite empirical tail control. This supplies kernel entries and squared hidden velocities without assuming sub-Gaussian tails.

For completeness, uniform velocity-energy bounds also supply the path-law assertion. For a time grid of spacing \(h\), let \(\pi_h t\) be its preceding grid point. Cauchy–Schwarz on each coordinate gives
\[
\frac1n\sum_i
\sup_{t\le T}
|z_i(t)-z_i(\pi_h t)|^2
\le
h\int_0^T
\frac{\|\dot z(t)\|_2^2}{n}\,dt.
\tag{23}
\]
The population counterpart replaces the empirical average by expectation. The parameter bounds above and the bounded activation derivatives bound these integrals uniformly for each hidden layer. Piecewise-linear reconstruction from the same grid satisfies an analogous estimate with a fixed additional factor. At fixed grid size the joint laws converge with second moments; letting \(h\to0\) gives convergence of the hidden path laws with their second moments in the uniform path norm. The clipped backward-field argument likewise identifies the integrated squared speeds.

## Examples and the input-geometry boundary

Either layer may use arctan, tanh, logistic sigmoid, erf with fixed nonzero input scaling, softsign \(z/(1+|z|)\), or the smooth saturation \(z/\sqrt{1+z^2}\). Sine and cosine also qualify, despite derivative zeros and sign changes. Softsign is not twice continuously differentiable at zero, but
\[
\frac{d}{dz}\frac{z}{1+|z|}
=
\frac1{(1+|z|)^2}
\]
is continuous, bounded, and globally Lipschitz, which is enough.

In the first layer only, affine functions, softplus, GELU, and SiLU also qualify: their derivatives are bounded and globally Lipschitz although the activations are unbounded. ReLU, leaky ReLU, hard tanh, and derivative-jump activations are not covered by this theorem.

For a general input Gram matrix
\[
G_{ab}=\frac{x_a^\top x_b}{d},
\]
the first-layer equation becomes
\[
\dot Z_a^{(1)}
=
-2\kappa_1\sum_b
G_{ab}r_b
(\phi^{(1)})'(Z_b^{(1)})
(W^{(2)})^*\delta_b^{(2)}.
\tag{24}
\]
With a nonlinear first activation, the right side is not the \(a\)-th activation derivative times one scalar backward coefficient. The scalar-coordinate proof therefore does not give a global-time arbitrary-angle theorem.

There is a verified exception. If
\[
\phi^{(1)}(z)=cz+d_0,
\]
then
\[
\dot Z_a^{(1)}
=
-2\kappa_1c\sum_b
G_{ab}r_b(W^{(2)})^*\delta_b^{(2)}.
\tag{25}
\]
The troublesome multiplication by a varying first-layer derivative has disappeared. In the raw state
\((Z_1^{(1)},\ldots,Z_m^{(1)},W^{(2)},W^{(3)})\),
the vector field is Lipschitz on the same bounded sets. The bounds (13)–(14) hold with raw first-layer norms and constants depending on the fixed \(G\). The fixed-program initialization allows the possibly singular Gaussian covariance \(\sigma_1^2G\). The same oracle and mesh proof therefore gives a global population limit for **any fixed finite normalized input configuration**, including singular Gram matrices.

In this affine case, raw GD is already ordinary Euler for the Lipschitz raw vector field, so the sufficient step condition improves to \(\eta_n\to0\). All the preceding readout restrictions remain. This exception does not give a nonlinear first layer: its best affine-fit error is exactly zero.

## Strict feature learning on a fixed short interval

The global theorem retains the earlier strict short-time conclusions under additional assumptions: take \(\sigma_1,\sigma_2>0\), all \(\kappa_\ell>0\), labels \(y_a\in\{-1,1\}\), zero limiting readout, a nonaffine \(\phi^{(1)}\), and a nonconstant \(\phi^{(2)}\). Keep the activation regularity assumptions above and mutually orthogonal inputs. Neither derivative needs a fixed sign, and both may vanish on intervals. The conclusions in this section hold on a fixed short interval along the globally existing solution; they do not assert strictly positive hidden speeds for all future times.

The first-layer roots are independent \(N(0,\sigma_1^2)\). Define
\[
Q_{ab}
=
\mathbb E[H_{0,a}^{(1)}H_{0,b}^{(1)}].
\]
For a standard Gaussian \(g\), put
\[
\mu=\mathbb E[\phi^{(1)}(\sigma_1g)],
\qquad
v=\operatorname{Var}(\phi^{(1)}(\sigma_1g)).
\]
Independence gives
\[
Q=vI+\mu^2\mathbf1\mathbf1^\top.
\]
Here \(v>0\): a continuous nonconstant activation cannot be constant on a full-support Gaussian law. Thus \(Q\) is positive definite. The initial second-layer tuple
\[
Y_a:=Z_{0,a}^{(2)}
\]
is Gaussian with covariance \(\sigma_2^2Q\) and full support. Its coordinates need not be independent when \(\mu\ne0\).

The following temporary quantities recur throughout the expansion:
\[
\begin{aligned}
S&=\sum_a y_a\phi^{(2)}(Y_a),
&
U_a&=S(\phi^{(2)})'(Y_a),\\
P_a&=(W_0^{(2)})^*U_a,
&
B_a&=(\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,a}^{(1)})P_a,\\
V_{ab}&=\mathbb E[U_aU_b],
&
D_{ab}&=\mathbb E[B_aB_b],
\qquad T_a=y_aB_a.
\end{aligned}
\tag{26}
\]

The matrix \(V\) is positive definite even when the second activation has flat parts. If \(\sum_a c_aU_a=0\) almost surely, continuity and full support give, for every \(s\in\mathbb R^m\),
\[
\left(\sum_a y_a\phi^{(2)}(s_a)\right)
\left(\sum_a c_a(\phi^{(2)})'(s_a)\right)=0.
\tag{27}
\]
Where the first factor is nonzero, the second is zero. Where the first is zero but some \((\phi^{(2)})'(s_a)\ne0\), its corresponding partial derivative is nonzero, so nearby points have nonzero first factor; continuity again makes the second factor zero. If every derivative is zero, the second factor is already zero. Consequently,
\[
\sum_a c_a(\phi^{(2)})'(s_a)=0
\quad\text{for every }s.
\]
The derivative \((\phi^{(2)})'\) is nonconstant, since a bounded activation with constant derivative would be constant. Varying one coordinate forces each \(c_a=0\). This proves positive definiteness without dividing by \(S\) on a possible positive-probability zero set.

The first reused transpose call has representation
\[
P_a
=
\sum_c H_{0,c}^{(1)}
[Q^{-1}\mathbb E(YU_a)]_c+\Gamma_a,
\qquad
\Gamma\sim N(0,\sigma_2^2V),
\tag{28}
\]
where \(\Gamma\) is independent of the first-layer roots. Hence, for any nonzero vector \(c\),
\[
\mathbb E\!\left[\left(\sum_a c_aB_a\right)^2\right]
\ge
\sigma_2^2\lambda_{\min}(V)
\sum_a c_a^2
\mathbb E[((\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,a}^{(1)}))^2]
>0.
\tag{29}
\]
A continuously differentiable nonconstant first activation has nonzero derivative on some interval, of positive Gaussian probability. Thus \(D\) is positive definite and every \(T_a\) is nonzero in mean square.

Define
\[
M_a=\sum_b y_bQ_{ab}U_b,
\qquad
A_a=(\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,a}^{(1)})T_a
=
y_a((\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,a}^{(1)}))^2P_a,
\]
\[
R_a^\kappa
=
\kappa_2M_a+\kappa_1W_0^{(2)}A_a.
\tag{30}
\]
Every \(R_a^\kappa\) is nonzero. To prove this without a cancellation assumption, subtract from \(A_a\) its mean-square projection onto the span of the initial \(H_{0,b}^{(1)}\), calling the remainder \(A_a^\perp\). Conditional variance in (28) gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb E[(A_a^\perp)^2]
&\ge
\mathbb E\operatorname{Var}(A_a\mid
Z_{0,1}^{(1)},\ldots,Z_{0,m}^{(1)})\\
&=
\sigma_2^2V_{aa}
\mathbb E[((\phi^{(1)})'(Z_{0,a}^{(1)}))^4]
>0.
\end{aligned}
\tag{31}
\]
Conditioning the initial matrix on the previously revealed forward and transpose calls gives
\[
W_0^{(2)}A_a
=
\sum_b\alpha_{a,b}Y_b
+\sum_b\beta_{a,b}U_b
+
\sigma_2\sqrt{\mathbb E[(A_a^\perp)^2]}\,\gamma_a,
\tag{32}
\]
where \(\gamma_a\) is standard Gaussian independent of the previous second-layer coordinates, and
\[
\alpha_a=Q^{-1}\mathbb E[H_0^{(1)}A_a],
\qquad
\beta_a=V^{-1}\mathbb E[PA_a^\perp].
\]
The formulas follow by conditioning simultaneously on the known products in both directions; the remaining matrix is an independent Gaussian projected off the explored input and output spans. Their finite-rank output projection vanishes in normalized mean square. This is a separate marginal calculation for each \(a\), not a claim that all \(\gamma_a\) are independent.

Since \(M_a\) depends only on \(Y\), it cannot cancel the independent Gaussian in (32). Therefore
\[
\mathbb E[(R_a^\kappa)^2]
\ge
\kappa_1^2\sigma_2^2
\mathbb E[(A_a^\perp)^2]>0.
\tag{33}
\]

Substitution in the integral equations yields
\[
\begin{aligned}
W^{(3)}(t)
&=2\kappa_3tS+o_{L^2}(t),\\
\delta_a^{(2)}(t)
&=2\kappa_3tU_a+o_{L^2}(t),\\
Z_a^{(1)}(t)-Z_{0,a}^{(1)}
&=2\kappa_1\kappa_3t^2T_a+o_{L^2}(t^2),\\
W^{(2)}(t)-W_0^{(2)}
&=
2\kappa_2\kappa_3t^2
\sum_b y_bU_b\otimes H_{0,b}^{(1)}
+o_{\mathrm{op}}(t^2),\\
Z_a^{(2)}(t)-Y_a
&=2\kappa_3t^2R_a^\kappa+o_{L^2}(t^2).
\end{aligned}
\tag{34}
\]
Bounded continuous activation derivatives justify the difference quotients along these mean-square converging increments by domination. Boundedness of the first activation itself is unnecessary. Direct substitution in the velocity equations also gives
\[
\frac{\dot Z_a^{(1)}(t)}t
\longrightarrow 4\kappa_1\kappa_3T_a,
\qquad
\frac{\dot Z_a^{(2)}(t)}t
\longrightarrow 4\kappa_3R_a^\kappa
\quad\text{in }L^2.
\tag{35}
\]

The middle matrix moves nontrivially even when tested on each fixed initial activation. Its leading response to \(H_{0,a}^{(1)}\) is \(2\kappa_2\kappa_3t^2M_a\). Indeed, with \(c_b=y_bQ_{ab}\),
\[
\mathbb E[M_a^2]=c^\top Vc>0,
\]
because \(c_a=y_aQ_{aa}\ne0\).

Put
\[
A_1=\sum_a y_a^2D_{aa}>0,
\qquad
A_2=\sum_{a,b}y_ay_bQ_{ab}V_{ab}>0.
\tag{36}
\]
For the second inequality, decompose \(Q=\sum_j v_jv_j^\top\). Its entrywise product with \(V\) is
\[
Q\circ V
=
\sum_j\operatorname{diag}(v_j)V\operatorname{diag}(v_j)
\succeq
\lambda_{\min}(V)\operatorname{diag}(Q_{11},\ldots,Q_{mm})
\succ0.
\]
Adjunction gives
\[
\sum_a y_a\mathbb E[U_aR_a^\kappa]
=
\kappa_1A_1+\kappa_2A_2.
\tag{37}
\]
Consequently,
\[
\begin{aligned}
\kappa_1K^{(1)}(t)
&=
4\kappa_1\kappa_3^2t^2
\operatorname{diag}(D_{11},\ldots,D_{mm})
+o(t^2),\\
\kappa_2K^{(2)}(t)
&=
4\kappa_2\kappa_3^2t^2(Q\circ V)
+o(t^2),\\
y^\top K^{(3)}(t)y
&=
\mathbb E[S^2]
+
4\kappa_3(\kappa_1A_1+\kappa_2A_2)t^2
+o(t^2),\\
y^\top K(t)y
&=
\kappa_3\mathbb E[S^2]
+
8\kappa_3^2(\kappa_1A_1+\kappa_2A_2)t^2
+o(t^2).
\end{aligned}
\tag{38}
\]
The initial readout block is positive definite: a linear dependence among the \(\phi^{(2)}(Y_a)\) would hold everywhere by full support, and varying one coordinate contradicts nonconstancy. Thus all three blocks are positive definite and individually nonconstant for sufficiently small positive times.

For each input and each hidden layer, (33)–(35) give constants \(c_{\ell,a},C_{\ell,a}>0\) and a common \(T_*>0\) such that
\[
c_{\ell,a}t
\le
\sqrt{\mathbb E[|\dot Z_a^{(\ell)}(t)|^2]}
\le
C_{\ell,a}t,
\qquad 0<t\le T_*.
\tag{39}
\]
The speeds survive the width and step limits at every fixed positive time, but start at zero and vanish linearly as \(t\downarrow0\). Squared displacement has a positive \(t^4\) coefficient; integrated squared speed has a positive \(t^3\) coefficient. There is no time-independent positive speed lower bound on \((0,T_*]\).

By contrast, the summed loss has a nonzero initial slope:
\[
-\dot L(0)=4\kappa_3\mathbb E[S^2]>0.
\]
After shrinking \(T_*\), its descent rate remains at least half this positive value throughout \([0,T_*]\). Individual residual magnitudes are not asserted to decrease.

Finally, every initial hidden marginal is a nondegenerate Gaussian. The first activation is nonaffine by assumption; the bounded nonconstant second activation is automatically nonaffine. Therefore the best affine-fit error
\[
\inf_{\alpha,\beta}
\mathbb E[(\phi^{(\ell)}(Z)-\alpha Z-\beta)^2]
=
\operatorname{Var}(\phi^{(\ell)}(Z))
-
\frac{\operatorname{Cov}(Z,\phi^{(\ell)}(Z))^2}
{\operatorname{Var}(Z)}
\tag{40}
\]
is initially positive for every hidden marginal. Its moments are continuous along the mean-square continuous paths, since both activations are globally Lipschitz and have at most linear growth. All hidden variances and best-affine-fit errors consequently have common positive lower bounds on a possibly shorter \([0,T_*]\).

These quantitative constants depend on the fixed activations, geometry, and positive hyperparameters, but not on width or learning rate. Global existence is proved on every finite horizon; the strict motion and nonlinearity bounds in this last section are asserted only on the stated fixed short interval.
