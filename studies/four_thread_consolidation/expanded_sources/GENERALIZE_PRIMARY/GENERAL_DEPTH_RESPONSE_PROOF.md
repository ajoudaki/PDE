# A weighted response and tail lemma at every fixed depth

This note proves the response/tail estimate needed by the local population
Euler construction. It does not by itself prove the oracle comparison or
the joint width/gradient-flow limit. Unlike the inherited depth draft, the
argument below permits unbounded activations and an unbounded subGaussian
initial readout. Its hypotheses include a preliminary uniform RMS ball;
that ball is supplied separately by the finite network/operator estimates.

Fix a finite number \(L\ge2\) of hidden layers and a finite dataset with
weights \(\omega_a>0\), \(\sum_a\omega_a=1\). Suppose
\(|G_{ab}|\le g\). No inverse Gram matrix is used. Each activation
\(\phi^{(\ell)}\) is \(C^2\), with

\[
\max_\ell\bigl(|\phi^{(\ell)}(0)|+
\|\phi^{(\ell)\prime}\|_\infty+
\|\phi^{(\ell)\prime\prime}\|_\infty\bigr)<\infty.
\]

The first-layer root vector has uniformly subGaussian scalar marginals.
The readout root \(W_0^{(L+1)}\) is subGaussian. Roots and initial middle
matrices are independent, and the middle matrices have independent
Gaussian entries with variance \(\sigma_\ell^2/n\). For invoking the
finite-program theorem, the roots must admit its initial-input
representation; Gaussian roots and polynomially bounded measurable
transforms of finitely many Gaussian roots suffice. This includes iid
subGaussian scalar first-weight entries at fixed input dimension and an
iid scalar subGaussian readout through their quantile representations.
The lemma below only uses the marginal subGaussian bounds on the resulting
first preactivations and readout.

All constants are independent of the Euler mesh, the number of mesh points,
the number of inputs, the individual weights, and covariance ranks. They
can depend on fixed depth, activation bounds, \(g\), initialization bounds,
learning constants, and the preliminary RMS/residual bounds. A common
existence time across datasets does not imply a width limit for a dataset
whose size increases with width.

## Exact recursions and hypotheses

For mesh \(\Delta\), write the population forward and backward operations
as

\[
H_{a,k}^{(\ell)}=\phi^{(\ell)}(Z_{a,k}^{(\ell)}),\qquad
P_{a,k}^{(L)}=W_k^{(L+1)},\qquad
\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}=
\phi^{(\ell)\prime}(Z_{a,k}^{(\ell)})P_{a,k}^{(\ell)}.
\tag{1}
\]

For \(\ell<L\), \(P_{a,k}^{(\ell)}=
(W_k^{(\ell+1)})^*\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell+1)}\). The Euler updates at the
two ends are

\[
Z_{a,k+1}^{(1)}=Z_{a,k}^{(1)}
-2\kappa_1\Delta\sum_b\omega_bG_{ab}r_{b,k}
\delta_{b,k}^{(1)},
\tag{2}
\]
\[
W_{k+1}^{(L+1)}=W_k^{(L+1)}
-2\kappa_{L+1}\Delta\sum_b\omega_b r_{b,k}H_{b,k}^{(L)}.
\tag{3}
\]

For every middle layer the update is

\[
W_{k+1}^{(\ell)}=W_k^{(\ell)}
-2\kappa_\ell\Delta\sum_b\omega_b r_{b,k}
\delta_{b,k}^{(\ell)}\otimes H_{b,k}^{(\ell-1)}.
\tag{4}
\]

For the lemma, the residuals in these recursions can be any deterministic
numbers with \(|r_{a,k}|\le R\). All deterministic residuals, contractions,
response coefficients, and Gaussian covariance laws are frozen in every
derivative below. There is no derivative through expectations.

Assume on a preliminary time interval \([0,T_{\rm ball}]\) that all source
RMS norms \(\|H_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\|_{L^2}\) and
\(\|\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\|_{L^2}\) are at most \(S\), uniformly in mesh.
In particular the training-memory coefficient bound is

\[
J=2\max_\ell\kappa_\ell R S^2,
\tag{5}
\]

and all Gaussian innovations below have standard deviations at most
\(S\max_\ell\sigma_\ell\).

For each initial middle matrix introduce forward slots
\(\xi_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\) and backward slots
\(\eta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\). Their covariances are

\[
\mathbb E[\xi_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\xi_{b,s}^{(\ell)}]
=\sigma_\ell^2\mathbb E[H_{a,k}^{(\ell-1)}H_{b,s}^{(\ell-1)}],
\quad
\mathbb E[\eta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\eta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}]
=\sigma_\ell^2\mathbb E[\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\delta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}].
\tag{6}
\]

Different matrix/orientation families are independent Gaussian families;
each family's own times and inputs are generally dependent. The
coordinate space of hidden population \(\ell\) uses its adjacent slots
\(\xi^{(\ell)}\) and \(\eta^{(\ell+1)}\), with the appropriate root at
the first/last layer. These are distinct neuron populations, not paired
finite-width coordinates.

Define unscaled expected derivatives

\[
A_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}=
\mathbb E\frac{\partial\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}}
{\partial\xi_{b,s}^{(\ell)}},\qquad s\le k,
\quad
C_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}=
\mathbb E\frac{\partial H_{a,k}^{(\ell-1)}}
{\partial\eta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}},\qquad s<k.
\tag{7}
\]

The exact local response representation is

\[
Z_{a,k}^{(\ell)}=\xi_{a,k}^{(\ell)}+
\sum_{b,s<k}F_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}\delta_{b,s}^{(\ell)},
\tag{8}
\]
\[
P_{a,k}^{(\ell-1)}=\eta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}+
\sum_{b,s\le k}D_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}H_{b,s}^{(\ell-1)},
\tag{9}
\]

where

\[
F_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}=
\sigma_\ell^2 C_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}
-2\kappa_\ell\Delta\omega_b r_{b,s}
\mathbb E[H_{b,s}^{(\ell-1)}H_{a,k}^{(\ell-1)}],
\tag{10}
\]
\[
D_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}=
\sigma_\ell^2 A_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}
-\mathbf1_{s<k}2\kappa_\ell\Delta\omega_b r_{b,s}
\mathbb E[\delta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}\delta_{a,k}^{(\ell)}].
\tag{11}
\]

For compact cap notation only, put
\(\widetilde A^{(\ell)}=\sigma_\ell^2 A^{(\ell)}\) and
\(\widetilde C^{(\ell)}=\sigma_\ell^2 C^{(\ell)}\).
Thus the sigma factors never enter the trained terms.

Equations (6)--(11) are the specialization of the fixed-program Gaussian
response rule in [Tensor Programs III, Box 1, Theorem 2.10, Remarks
2.11--2.12](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10685). The precise external input
needed here is: a fixed finite program built from independent Gaussian
matrices, their transposes, and polynomially bounded coordinate operations
has the empirical coordinate limit given by those response rules. The
derivative in its response is the partial derivative in independent formal
slots, with deterministic coefficients fixed. No nonsingularity is needed:
different symbolic representations in covariance-null directions give the
same response in mean square. Here activations grow at most linearly,
their first two derivatives are bounded, and the fixed finite recursive
expressions and their first slot derivatives have polynomial growth.
Consequently the rule applies and every displayed derivative expectation
exists. The uniform estimates proved next are additional to the
fixed-program theorem.

## SubGaussian sums without maxima of Gaussian histories

For a scalar random variable define

\[
\mathcal N(U)=\sup_{p\ge2}\frac{\|U\|_{L^p}}{\sqrt p}.
\tag{12}
\]

It is a norm, and \(\mathcal N(U)\le B\) implies

\[
\mathbb E\exp\bigl(U^2/(8eB^2)\bigr)\le4/3,
\quad
\mathbb E e^{\lambda|U|}\le(4/3)e^{2e\lambda^2B^2}.
\tag{13}
\]

Indeed the \(r\)-th term in the first exponential series is at most
\((2r)^r/((8e)^rr!)\le4^{-r}\); the second inequality follows by
\(\lambda|U|\le U^2/(8eB^2)+2e\lambda^2B^2\). The case \(B=0\) is
understood as \(U=0\).

If each \(U_{b,s}\) has \(\mathcal N(U_{b,s})\le B\), Jensen applied
with weights \(\Delta\omega_b/(k\Delta)\) gives

\[
\mathbb E\exp\left(\lambda\Delta
\sum_{s<k}\sum_b\omega_b|U_{b,s}|\right)
\le(4/3)\exp(2e\lambda^2T^2B^2),\qquad k\Delta\le T.
\tag{14}
\]

This requires no independence over time or inputs. The maximum of Gaussian
coordinates or of a Gaussian history is never bounded in this argument.

## The simultaneous field and response bounds

We prove that there exist fixed finite caps \(a_\ell,c_\ell\), constants
\(B_H,B_{P,\ell}\), and \(T_0>0\), with \(T_0\le T_{\rm ball}\), such
that at every mesh point up to \(T_0\)

\[
\sum_{b,s\le k}|\widetilde A_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|\le a_\ell,
\qquad
|\widetilde C_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|\le c_\ell\Delta\omega_b,
\tag{15}
\]
\[
\mathcal N(H_{a,k}^{(\ell)})\le B_H,
\qquad
\mathcal N(P_{a,k}^{(\ell)})\le B_{P,\ell}.
\tag{16}
\]

Set \(f_\ell=c_\ell+J\) for \(\ell\ge2\), and \(f_1=1\).
Under the response caps,

\[
|F_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|\le f_\ell\Delta\omega_b,
\qquad
\sum_{b,s\le k}|D_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|\le a_\ell+JT.
\tag{17}
\]

Choose a constant \(K\ge2\), depending only on the fixed bounds in the
lemma, large enough to dominate every root/innovation \(\mathcal N\)-norm
after applying an activation and every coefficient in (2)--(3). Fix this
\(K\) once. The triangle inequality for \(\mathcal N\), (1)--(3), and
(8)--(9) give the following bounds using only already constructed fields:

\[
\mathcal N(H_{a,k}^{(1)})\le K+KT\sup_{b,s<k}
\mathcal N(P_{b,s}^{(1)}),
\tag{18}
\]
\[
\mathcal N(H_{a,k}^{(\ell)})\le K+Kf_\ell T
\sup_{b,s<k}\mathcal N(P_{b,s}^{(\ell)}),\quad 2\le\ell\le L,
\tag{19}
\]
\[
\mathcal N(P_{a,k}^{(\ell)})\le K+(a_{\ell+1}+JT)
\sup_{b,s\le k}\mathcal N(H_{b,s}^{(\ell)}),\quad\ell<L,
\tag{20}
\]
\[
\mathcal N(W_k^{(L+1)})\le K+KT
\sup_{b,s<k}\mathcal N(H_{b,s}^{(L)}).
\tag{21}
\]

Take

\[
B_H=2K,\qquad B_{P,L}=2K,\qquad
B_{P,\ell}=4K(1+a_{\ell+1})\quad(\ell<L).
\tag{22}
\]

Once response caps have been chosen, (18)--(21) preserve these field caps
if \(JT\le1\), \(2KT\le1\), and
\(f_\ell T B_{P,\ell}\le1\) for every \(1\le\ell\le L\).
For (20), its right side is at most
\(K+2K(a_{\ell+1}+1)\le4K(1+a_{\ell+1})\).
For each finite mesh all \(\mathcal N\)-norms are finite before this
estimate: the causal magnitude recursions bound each field by a finite
deterministic linear combination of absolute roots/innovations, since
\(|\phi(z)|\le M(1+|z|)\) and \(|\delta|\le M|P|\).

## Full forward-slot derivative rows

Fix a layer \(2\le\ell\le L\). Differentiate only with respect to its
own forward slots \(\xi^{(\ell)}\); hold the adjacent backward slots and
roots fixed. Let

\[
v_{a,k}^{(\ell)}=
\sum_{b,s\le k}\left|
\frac{\partial Z_{a,k}^{(\ell)}}{\partial\xi_{b,s}^{(\ell)}}
\right|,\qquad
V_k^{(\ell)}=\max_{a,u\le k}v_{a,u}^{(\ell)}.
\tag{23}
\]

The maximum here is a maximum of derivative row sums, not of random
backward fields. Write \(d_\ell=1+a_{\ell+1}\) if \(\ell<L\), and
\(d_L=1\). Let \(M\ge1\) dominate all activation bounds.

For \(\ell<L\), direct differentiation of (9) gives

\[
\sum_{b,s}\left|
\frac{\partial P_{a,u}^{(\ell)}}{\partial\xi_{b,s}^{(\ell)}}
\right|
\le M(a_{\ell+1}+JT)V_u^{(\ell)}.
\tag{24}
\]

For the last layer, differentiating the integrated readout update (3)
instead gives a bound \(2\kappa_{L+1}RMTV_u^{(L)}\).
The product rule in (1), with these bounds, proves for a fixed constant
\(C\) depending only on the lemma's data that

\[
\sum_{b,s}\left|
\frac{\partial\delta_{a,u}^{(\ell)}}
{\partial\xi_{b,s}^{(\ell)}}\right|
\le C\bigl(|P_{a,u}^{(\ell)}|+d_\ell\bigr)V_u^{(\ell)}.
\tag{25}
\]

The first term in (8) has derivative row sum exactly one. Its memory has
only earlier times. By the entrywise estimate (17),

\[
V_k^{(\ell)}\le1+Cf_\ell\Delta\sum_{u<k}
\left(d_\ell+\sum_b\omega_b|P_{b,u}^{(\ell)}|\right)V_u^{(\ell)}.
\tag{26}
\]

To justify the prefix maximum, the bound for every earlier time is no
larger than the displayed right side because every summand is nonnegative.
Discrete Gronwall gives

\[
V_k^{(\ell)}\le
\exp\left(Cf_\ell T d_\ell+
Cf_\ell\Delta\sum_{u<k}\sum_b\omega_b|P_{b,u}^{(\ell)}|\right).
\tag{27}
\]

Using (14), then Cauchy--Schwarz in (25), yields

\[
\sum_{b,s\le k}|\widetilde A_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|
\le C(B_{P,\ell}+d_\ell)
\exp\left(Cf_\ell T d_\ell+
Cf_\ell^2T^2B_{P,\ell}^2\right).
\tag{28}
\]

Here and in the remaining estimates choose one \(C\ge1\) large enough
for all displayed inequalities, and fix it before choosing response caps.
There are finitely many algebraic bound types; neither \(C\) nor \(K\)
depends on a response cap. Notice that (28) uses
\(\|P_{a,k}^{(\ell)}\|_{L^2}\|V_k^{(\ell)}\|_{L^2}\), not the
\(L^2\)-norm of a maximum over the input index or time.

## A single backward-slot pulse

Fix \(\ell\ge2\), one input \(b\), one time \(s\), and differentiate
the local coordinate functions of layer \(\ell-1\) with respect to the
single slot \(\eta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}\). Put

\[
D_k=\max_{a,u\le k}\left|
\frac{\partial Z_{a,u}^{(\ell-1)}}
{\partial\eta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}}\right|.
\tag{29}
\]

It vanishes for \(k\le s\). Differentiating (9) and (1) gives, pointwise,

\[
\left|\frac{\partial\delta_{a,u}^{(\ell-1)}}
{\partial\eta_{b,s}^{(\ell)}}\right|
\le M\mathbf1_{a=b,u=s}
+C\bigl(|P_{a,u}^{(\ell-1)}|+d_{\ell-1}\bigr)D_u.
\tag{30}
\]

Indeed the derivative of the direct Gaussian term in (9) is precisely
\(\mathbf1_{a=b,u=s}\); the derivative of its response has magnitude
at most \(M(a_\ell+JT)D_u\). The other product-rule term is bounded by
\(M|P_{a,u}^{(\ell-1)}|D_u\).

For \(\ell=2\), insert (30) in the accumulated update (2). Its direct
pulse has magnitude at most \(2\kappa_1gRM\Delta\omega_b\).
For \(\ell\ge3\), insert it in (8) for layer \(\ell-1\); the direct
pulse has magnitude at most \(Mf_{\ell-1}\Delta\omega_b\).
Both cases therefore obey, for \(k>s\),

\[
D_k\le Cf_{\ell-1}\Delta\omega_b+
Cf_{\ell-1}\Delta\sum_{u<k}
\left(d_{\ell-1}+\sum_a\omega_a|P_{a,u}^{(\ell-1)}|\right)D_u.
\tag{31}
\]

Here \(f_1=1\). Gronwall, (14), and the bounded activation derivative
give

\[
\frac{|\widetilde C_{ak,bs}^{(\ell)}|}{\Delta\omega_b}
\le Cf_{\ell-1}
\exp\left(Cf_{\ell-1}T d_{\ell-1}+
Cf_{\ell-1}^2T^2B_{P,\ell-1}^2\right).
\tag{32}
\]

The factor \(\Delta\omega_b\) is retained from one source pulse. There
is no factor \(1/\omega_b\) in any constant and no sum of unweighted
Gaussian absolute values.

## Cap selection and literal construction order

First choose the forward-response caps from bottom to top:

\[
c_2=4C,\qquad c_\ell=4C(c_{\ell-1}+J),\quad3\le\ell\le L.
\tag{33}
\]

These use only the \(T=0\) prefactors in (32), which do not contain any
backward cap. Next choose the backward-response caps from top to bottom:

\[
a_L=4C(2K+1),\qquad
a_\ell=4C(4K+1)(1+a_{\ell+1}),\quad 2\le\ell<L.
\tag{34}
\]

These dominate four times the \(T=0\) prefactors of (28), using (22).
All caps are now fixed finite numbers. Choose \(T_0>0\) satisfying

\[
T_0\le\min(T_{\rm ball},1),\quad JT_0\le1,\quad2KT_0\le1,
\quad f_\ell T_0 B_{P,\ell}\le1\quad(1\le\ell\le L),
\tag{35}
\]

and such that every exponent on the right sides of (28) and (32) is at
most \(\log2\) when \(T=T_0\). Each exponent tends to zero with \(T\)
after the caps have been fixed; there are finitely many of them. Thus this
choice gives a strictly positive time depending only on the stated data.
Equations (28) and (32) then improve their respective response caps by a
factor of two.

For completeness, this is an induction on the actual causal construction,
not a bootstrap that assumes all future tails:

1. At time \(k\), \(W_k^{(L+1)}\) and \(Z_{a,k}^{(1)}\) use only
   histories before \(k\). Verify their bounds from (18), (21).
2. Construct the current forward layers in order \(2,\ldots,L\).
   Before constructing layer \(\ell\), its coefficient
   \(\widetilde C^{(\ell)}\) is computed from the already constructed
   \(H^{(\ell-1)}\). Estimate (32) uses only past
   \(P^{(\ell-1)}\), whose tails and backward response caps are known,
   and the current lower-layer forward cap, which is already known.
   Equation (19) then verifies the current \(H^{(\ell)}\) bound using
   only past \(P^{(\ell)}\). This constructs the current innovations'
   source covariances too.
3. Construct the current backward layers in order \(L,\ldots,2\).
   At the top \(P^{(L)}=W^{(L+1)}\) is already bounded. At a lower
   layer \(\ell\), the current \(P^{(\ell)}\) was just constructed
   using the current higher response \(\widetilde A^{(\ell+1)}\);
   (20) verifies its cap. Hence (25)--(28) use known current
   \(P^{(\ell)}\) tails and known upper response coefficients. They
   verify the current \(\widetilde A^{(\ell)}\) cap, after which (9)
   constructs \(P^{(\ell-1)}\).
4. Apply (2)--(3) for the next step and repeat.

At \(k=0\) there is no forward response memory. The same top-down
backward construction starts from the readout root; (28) has \(V_0=1\).
Thus the induction starts without zero-readout or centered-readout
assumptions. Neither a current forward coefficient nor a current backward
coefficient needs its own unconstructed value. This proves (15)--(16).

In particular, for some fixed \(c_*,C_*>0\),

\[
\sup_\Delta\sup_{k\Delta\le T_0}\max_{a,\ell}
\mathbb E\exp\left(c_*|P_{a,k}^{(\ell)}|^2\right)\le C_*.
\tag{36}
\]

The same statement holds for every hidden activation and, by (2) and
(8), every preactivation. It implies the uniform RMS cutoff-tail bound
\(\|P\mathbf1_{|P|>R}\|_{L^2}\le C e^{-cR^2}\), after decreasing
\(c\). No bound on a maximum over neurons, dataset elements, or time was
proved or needed.

The proof also holds for arbitrary deterministic positive step lengths
\(\Delta_s\) with total time at most \(T_0\): replace every source factor
\(\Delta\omega_b\) at time \(s\) by \(\Delta_s\omega_b\), and replace
\(k\Delta\) by \(\sum_{s<k}\Delta_s\). The Jensen weights in (14) become
\(\Delta_s\omega_b/\sum_{u<k}\Delta_u\); the single-slot pulse in (31) is
exactly \(\Delta_s\omega_b\); every Gronwall estimate uses only total
time. Nothing else changes. Consequently (36) also holds for fields
recomputed at an affine Euler-state interpolation time: append one final
Euler update of length \(\theta\Delta\), \(0<\theta<1\), to the preceding
full steps, and evaluate the full forward/backward network there. The
constants are independent of \(\theta\). This bounds each interpolation
time; it is not a tail bound for a supremum of the path.

## Consequences and boundaries

The depth extension therefore supplies the required Gaussian-tail part of
the reference comparison for smooth globally Lipschitz activations,
including when their values and the initial readout are unbounded. The
remaining proof must provide the preliminary RMS/operator ball, the
common operator realization, the oracle interpolation comparison, and its
order of limits. This note does not certify those separate steps.

The exact same lemma holds when each \(2r_{a,k}\) in (2)--(4) is replaced
by any deterministic coefficient uniformly bounded on the preliminary
ball. This permits a general-loss theorem once that theorem proves the
required boundedness and feedback Lipschitz estimate for the loss
derivative.

The constants only use uniform bounds on \(\phi\)'s value at zero and
its first two derivatives. Thus this lemma is uniform under smooth
mollifications of globally Lipschitz \(C^{1,1}\) activations. Passing from
the mollified flows to the original activation still requires the
separate stability argument. ReLU has discontinuous derivative and is not
covered by this lemma or this mollification statement.

The proof is for every fixed finite depth; its constants can grow rapidly
with depth. It proves neither a depth-uniform interval nor arbitrary-depth
strict feature activity. Those are different claims.
