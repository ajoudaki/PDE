# Quantitative reference response tails for the tanh clock

Author: `/root/response`. This is a research proof component, not a
promotion of the new result. It treats only the opposite-label orthogonal
reference in the stated two-hidden-layer model. Its role is to supply the
one-reference tails required by C.4.1 on the useful learning horizon.

The dependencies used here are the complete Gaussian conditioning,
singular-query and common-action proofs in `docs/special_data_limits.md`
I.3.1–I.3.7 and III.F.1–III.F.9, and the global clock construction in
`docs/global_nonlinear.md` B.1. The new source argument below is necessary:
B.1's continuous-value extension by itself gives no response formula.
The reference fitting component `REFERENCE.md` supplies the energy facts
stated in (R3).
All other estimates needed in this component are proved below.

## 1. Exact feature equations and the bounded reference interval

Put `sigma_1=1`, `sigma_2=-1`, and `phi=tanh`. Let `J` be the global
scalar solution

\[
 J_X(X,g)=\operatorname{sech}^2 J(X,g),\qquad J(0,g)=g,
 \quad H(X,g)=\tanh J(X,g).                                      \tag{R1}
\]

Here `X` is a clock argument; `g` is a fixed Gaussian first-row root.
For each fixed `g`, scalar existence and uniqueness follow from boundedness
and global Lipschitz continuity of `sech²`. In particular
`|J(X,g)|<=|g|+|X|`, `|J(X,g)-J(Y,g)|<=|X-Y|`, and
`H_X=sech⁴ J`, so `|H_X|<=1`. There is no globally bounded derivative
assumption in the root `g`.

The feature equations on the two separate neuron probability spaces are

\[
\begin{aligned}
 H_a^1&=H(X_a,g_a),& Z_a^2&=A H_a^1,&H_a^2&=\phi(Z_a^2),\\
 \delta_a&=c\phi'(Z_a^2),& Q_a&=A^*\delta_a,\\
 X_{a,s}&=\tfrac12\sigma_a Q_a,&
 A_s&=\tfrac12\sum_a\sigma_a\delta_a\otimes H_a^1,&
 c_s&=\tfrac12\sum_a\sigma_a H_a^2 .
\end{aligned}                                                     \tag{R2}
\]

The initialized action and its adjoint are the common Gaussian action,
and `X(0)=0,c(0)=0`. The rank action is
`(v tensor h)z=v E_1[hz]`. At finite width it is `v h^T/n`.
These equations are the actual reference flow under
`ds/dt=2(1-b)`, up to its feature endpoint `s_infty`. They are also a
well-defined auxiliary autonomous feature system beyond that endpoint,
but no estimate below requires that extension.

Write `m=|| (H_1^2(0)-H_2^2(0))/2 ||_2²`. The reference fitting proof
establishes

\[
 m\ge1/10,\quad 0<s_\infty\le1/m\le10,\quad
 \|\theta(s)-\theta(0)\|_{\rm raw}\le\sqrt{s\,b(s)}\le\sqrt{10}
 \quad(0\le s\le s_\infty).                                      \tag{R3}
\]

The raw increment norm is the square sum of the full first-row L2 norm,
the middle Hilbert–Schmidt norm and the readout L2 norm. Therefore
`||A-A_0||HS<=sqrt(10)`, `||c||2<=sqrt(10)`, and (R2) independently gives
`||c(s)||infinity<=s`. The canonical initialized action has norm at most
two; its finite counterpart has norm at most three with probability
tending to one, by the contained proof in global nonlinear A.3.

Only meshes with terminal point at most `s_infty` will be used. For all
sufficiently fine such meshes, their population Euler paths have
`||A-A_0||HS<sqrt(10)+1/10`, `||c||2<sqrt(10)+1/10`.
Here is why the Hilbert–Schmidt assertion follows from the clock proof.
Replace the action difference in B.1's metric by the Hilbert–Schmidt norm
of its learned increment. The forward and adjoint difference bounds still
hold because `||K||op<=||K||HS`; the rank difference bound is identical in
these two norms. The same integrated contraction argument and Euler
recurrence give convergence in this stronger metric on each bounded
interval. This argument applies to (R2), whose controls are fixed signs
instead of residual feedback. Its elementary global finite-feature bounds
are `||c||infinity<=s`, `||A||op<=||A_0||op+s²/2`, and
`sum_a ||X_a||2<=integral_0^s ||A(v)||op v dv`. They provide the bounded
sets needed before using (R3).

At each fixed mesh the finite-program value theorem identifies every
contraction in the finitely many learned ranks. Their HS norm squared is
the finite double sum of the corresponding two Gram entries. Thus the
finite learned increments have the same HS bounds, with an arbitrarily
small slack, with probability tending to one. The finite unforced mesh
therefore lies strictly inside

\[
 \|A\|_{\rm op}<7,\qquad \|c\|_2<4,\qquad
 \|c(s_k)\|_\infty\le s_k .                                      \tag{R4}
\]

The finite initial readout is set to zero only for these auxiliary source
programs. The actual-network reference bridge at the end retains the
specified finite Gaussian readout.

## 2. The source rule for the tanh clock, including zero forcing

At a fixed mesh with steps `h_k`, set `gamma_ka=h_k sigma_a/2` and make
both forward calls before both reverse calls, followed by simultaneous
updates (R2). On population 1 retain the entire root `(g_1,g_2)`. The scalar
source recursion is

\[
\begin{aligned}
 X_{ka}&=\sum_{r<k}\gamma_{ra} Q_{ra},&H^1_{ka}&=H(X_{ka},g_a),\\
 Z^2_{ka}&=\xi_{ka}+\sum_{r<k,b}a_{ka,rb}\delta_{rb},&
 c_k&=\sum_{r<k,b}\gamma_{rb}\phi(Z^2_{rb}),\\
 \delta_{ka}&=c_k\phi'(Z^2_{ka}),&
 Q_{ka}&=\zeta_{ka}+\sum_{r\le k,b}b_{ka,rb}H^1_{rb},\\
 a_{ka,rb}&=\alpha_{ka,rb}+\gamma_{rb}E_1[H^1_{ka}H^1_{rb}],&
 \alpha_{ka,rb}&=E_1[\partial_{\zeta_{rb}}H^1_{ka}],\\
 b_{ka,rb}&=\beta_{ka,rb}+1_{r<k}\gamma_{rb}E_2[\delta_{ka}\delta_{rb}],&
 \beta_{ka,rb}&=E_2[\partial_{\xi_{rb}}\delta_{ka}].
\end{aligned}                                                     \tag{R5}
\]

The centered source covariances, also between programs sharing the initial
matrix, are

\[
 E_2[\xi_{ka}\xi_{vb}]=E_1[H^1_{ka}H^1_{vb}],\qquad
 E_1[\zeta_{ka}\zeta_{vb}]=E_2[\delta_{ka}\delta_{vb}].             \tag{R6}
\]

The reverse Gaussian group is independent of the full first-row root.
Sources in different orientations belong to independent groups; the actual
matrix answers are dependent through their response terms. Formal
derivatives hold selected expectations, contraction coefficients and
covariances fixed. All named slots are retained even at zero variance.
Their complete chain rules include

\[
\begin{aligned}
 \partial X_{ka}&=\sum_{r<k}\gamma_{ra}\partial Q_{ra},&
 \partial H^1_{ka}&=\operatorname{sech}^4 J(X_{ka},g_a)\partial X_{ka},\\
 \partial c_k&=\sum_{r<k,b}\gamma_{rb}\phi'(Z^2_{rb})\partial Z^2_{rb},&
 \partial\delta_{ka}&=\phi'(Z^2_{ka})\partial c_k
             +c_k\phi''(Z^2_{ka})\partial Z^2_{ka},\\
 \beta_{ka,kb}&=1_{a=b}E_2[c_k\phi''(Z^2_{ka})].
\end{aligned}                                                     \tag{R7}
\]

We justify this source statement, rather than inferring it from values.
Choose a smooth root clipping function `chi_R` equal to the identity on
`[-R,R]`, with bounded image and `|chi_R'|<=1`, and replace `H(X,g)` by
`H(X,chi_R(g))`. Positivity of the scalar gate gives the exact identity

\[
 J_g(X,g)=\frac{\operatorname{sech}^2 J(X,g)}{
                         \operatorname{sech}^2 g}.
\]

One may derive it by differentiating the scalar ODE and solving its scalar
linear variational equation, or by differentiating
`F(J)=F(g)+X`, where `F(z)=z/2+sinh(2z)/4`.
Thus the clipped-root map has bounded first derivatives in both arguments.
Its `X` derivative stays bounded by one uniformly in `R`. Clip the readout
factor smoothly, with the clipping map equal to the identity on an open
neighborhood of the deterministic interval `[-10,10]`; since
`||c||infinity<=s_k<=10`, this changes no program value. All resulting
coordinate instructions now have bounded first derivatives, so III.F.1–5
applies, including its complete Gaussian conditioning proof and its
zero-query-noise argument. Expanding the learned ranks gives exactly (R5).

There is a uniform bound on every first *source* derivative of every fixed
scalar graph while earlier selected coefficients lie in a compact set.
Indeed the recursion has finitely many steps, `H_X` is bounded by one,
`|phi'|<=1`, `|phi''|<=2`, the readout is bounded, and every matrix node
is a source plus a finite linear combination of earlier nodes. Induction
through (R7) gives a finite deterministic bound. This bound is independent
of `R`: derivatives with respect to the root are never taken.

Now remove the root clipping chronologically. A convergent finite
covariance matrix has convergent positive-semidefinite square roots:
boundedness gives subsequential limits, each limit is a nonnegative square
root of the same matrix, and diagonalization gives its uniqueness. Couple
source prefixes using these square roots and fixed standard Gaussians.
At each finite instruction the expressions converge in probability.
The source derivative bound just proved gives uniform integrability of
their derivatives, so expected derivatives converge. Values are bounded or
have a common linear envelope in the finite source/root list, yielding L2
convergence. This closes the chronological induction for both coefficients
and values, even at a singular covariance. In particular the limit of (R7)
is precisely its displayed uncut expression.

These scalar values are the actual finite-program limits. For completeness,
on the same finite arrays the direct change of a first activation caused
by root clipping, at a fixed clock, has RMS at most
`2 [n^(-1) sum_i 1_{|g_ai|>R}]^(1/2)`. The rest of its change is bounded
by the clock RMS change because `|H_X|<=1`. Initial operator bounds and
finite graph subtraction then propagate these errors through every node.
The empirical Gaussian tail frequency converges by the elementary iid
law of large numbers. At each fixed clipping level the finite-program
theorem already applies; first let width grow, then remove clipping.
This identifies the scalar limit above with the uncut value limit.
Scalar contractions are treated in their causal order: their difference
is bounded by the two RMS errors times the bounded RMS factors, so the
same finite induction includes their actual empirical feedback. No
all-moment finite-width theorem or derivative in `g` is used.

Exactly the same argument covers a fresh root added with coefficient
`epsilon` to one complete query answer. For a fixed finite graph its
coefficients and expected source derivatives are continuous as
`epsilon->0`: the causal induction, covariance square-root coupling and
uniform source derivative bounds apply unchanged for `|epsilon|<=1`.
The expression convention fixes derivatives of variance-zero slots.
This continuity is what permits the final zero-forcing limit below.

## 3. Explicit fresh-root pulse estimates

For two states with the same first roots, use

\[
 d=x+a+z,\quad x=\sum_{a=1}^2\|X_a-\bar X_a\|_2,\quad
 a=\|A-\bar A\|_{\rm op},\quad z=\|c-\bar c\|_2 .              \tag{R8}
\]

At finite width use explicitly
`x_n=sum_a ||X_na-bar X_na||_2/sqrt(n)`,
`a_n=||A_n-bar A_n||op`, and
`z_n=||c_n-bar c_n||_2/sqrt(n)`.
All finite Euclidean norms retain their ordinary meaning.

Suppose both states satisfy `||A||op<=M`, `||c||2<=C`, and
`||c||infinity<=s`. At a feature time `s`, factor subtraction gives

\[
\begin{aligned}
 \sum_a\|\Delta Z_a^2\|_2&\le2a+Mx,\\
 \sum_a\|\Delta\delta_a\|_2&\le2z+4sa+2sMx,\\
 \sum_a\|\Delta Q_a\|_2&\le2Ca+M(2z+4sa+2sMx).
\end{aligned}                                                     \tag{R9}
\]

For example the first term in the final line is the change of action
applied to a backward field of norm at most `C`; both such fields occur.
The three velocity differences, in the order of (R8), are consequently
bounded by

\[
\begin{aligned}
 \Delta F_X&\le sM^2x+(C+2sM)a+Mz,\\
 \Delta F_A&\le(sM+C/2)x+2sa+z,\\
 \Delta F_c&\le(M/2)x+a.
\end{aligned}                                                     \tag{R10}
\]

In the middle line the rank-one difference has norm at most
`||Delta delta||2+C||Delta H^1||2`. This verifies the estimate in
operator norm and also for a HS action difference. With `M=7,C=4`, the
sum is at most `L(s)d`, where

\[
 L(s)=\max\{8,5+16s,11/2+56s\}\le8+56s,
 \qquad E:=\exp(8S+28S^2),\quad S=10.                           \tag{R11}
\]

For a mesh ending by `S`, the subsequent Euler amplification is at most
`prod_k(1+h_k L(s_k))<=exp(sum_k h_k(8+56s_k))<=E`, since the
left Riemann sum of the increasing integrand is no larger than its
integral. Thus `E=exp(2880)`.

The required ball is legitimate for forcing. First choose the unforced
mesh sufficiently fine for (R4). At that fixed mesh and sufficiently
large width, all its state bounds hold with positive slack on an event
whose probability tends to one. Finite same-array subtraction, initially
using the crude global feature bounds, shows that the forced graph stays
within the ball `M=7,C=4` for all sufficiently small fixed `|epsilon|`
on this event and on `||e||2/sqrt(n)<=2`. The permitted epsilon may depend
on the fixed mesh but not on width. All later estimates therefore use
the uniform constants (R11). The readout supremum bound survives every
forcing exactly, because every readout increment is still a difference
of two bounded tanh activations. This is a local forcing argument at
zero, not a claim that arbitrary forcing preserves the energy identity.

Insert `epsilon e` into the complete reverse answer `Q_jb`, keeping all
earlier answers and the matrix fixed and recomputing its descendants.
The only immediate state increment is `h_j sigma_b epsilon e/2` in its
clock. Therefore, for `k>j`,

\[
 \frac{\|H^{1,\epsilon}_{n,ka}-H^{1,0}_{n,ka}\|_2}{\sqrt n}
       \le\tfrac12h_j E|\epsilon|\frac{\|e_n\|_2}{\sqrt n} .     \tag{R12}
\]

Instead insert the fresh root into one complete forward answer `Z^2_jb`.
Its activation changes in RMS by at most
`|epsilon| ||e_n||2/sqrt(n)`, its delta by at most
`2s_j |epsilon| ||e_n||2/sqrt(n)`, and its reverse answer by at most
`2Ms_j |epsilon| ||e_n||2/sqrt(n)`. The three immediate state changes have
total distance at most `h_j P |epsilon| ||e_n||2/sqrt(n)`, where

\[
 P=(M+1)S+1/2=161/2.
\]

At a later node a single delta difference is at most
`z+2s(a+M x)<=K d`, with

\[
 K=\max\{1,2SM\}=140.
\]

Consequently, for `k>j`,

\[
 \frac{\|\delta^\epsilon_{n,ka}-\delta^0_{n,ka}\|_2}{\sqrt n}
           \le h_j P K E |\epsilon|\frac{\|e_n\|_2}{\sqrt n} .  \tag{R13}
\]

We now extract the named coefficients with the precise order of limits.
Fix the mesh and a sufficiently small nonzero epsilon; apply the proved
joint value/source theorem to the forced and unforced graphs and the root,
letting width tend to infinity first. In its own population the new root
enters the complete scalar expression only through replacement of the
specified named source slot by that slot plus `epsilon e`. All Gaussian
source groups are independent of this local root. Their selected
covariances and all selected coefficients may depend on epsilon, but
are deterministic, and are held fixed under coordinate differentiation.
Induction through the expression gives

\[
 \partial_e V^\epsilon=\epsilon\partial_{\rm slot}V^\epsilon,
 \qquad E[eV^\epsilon]=\epsilon E[\partial_{\rm slot}V^\epsilon].  \tag{R14}
\]

The second identity is one-dimensional Gaussian integration by parts
conditional on the other roots and source groups. Its boundary term
vanishes, since these output values and first derivatives are bounded
at a fixed graph. The unused root is independent of the unforced graph,
so `E[eV^0]=0`. Passing the finite Cauchy–Schwarz pairing inequality to
the joint W2 limit in (R12) or (R13), and using `E[e²]=1`, bounds (R14)
after division by `|epsilon|`. Only then let epsilon tend to zero. The
coefficient and derivative continuity proved in Section 2 gives exactly

\[
 |\alpha_{ka,jb}|\le h_j E/2\ (j<k),\qquad
 |\beta_{ka,jb}|\le h_j P K E\ (j<k),\qquad
 |\beta_{ka,kb}|\le2S\,1_{a=b}.                                 \tag{R15}
\]

This order does not infer a derivative transverse to an unforced singular
support from its value law. The fresh root, the finite forcing estimate,
the source-form identity and the zero-forcing continuity each have a
separate role.

## 4. Explicit Gaussian remainders and their passage to the flow

The two source variances in (R6) are at most `1` and `C²=16`. The
forward response remainder is bounded by
`S²(E+1)`, using (R15), `|delta|<=S` and `|E[H^1 H^1]|<=1`.
For a reverse answer, all past response coefficients have total absolute
sum at most `2S P K E`. Its learned coefficients have total absolute sum
at most `S C²`, since `|E[delta delta']|<=C²`. The two current
source coefficients contribute at most `2S` in total (only the matching
current sample occurs). Since `|H^1|<=1`,

\[
 Z^2_{ka}=\xi_{ka}+B_{ka},\quad |B_{ka}|\le100(E+1),\qquad
 Q_{ka}=\zeta_{ka}+D_{ka},\quad |D_{ka}|\le B_Q,
 \quad B_Q:=225400e^{2880}+180 .                                 \tag{R16}
\]

All constants are independent of the mesh, its number of nodes and width.
Their statements for mesh scalar laws require only sufficiently fine
meshes ending by `s_infty`, as already specified.

For clarity this decomposition passes to the already constructed common
flow, not merely to marginal subsequences. Adjoin a countable refining
mesh family to the common Gaussian language. Cross-program covariance
(R6) gives
`||xi_H-xi_H'||2=||H-H'||2` and
`||zeta_delta-zeta_delta'||2=||delta-delta'||2`.
These Gaussian source assignments extend by isometry to the closures of
their input spans. The transformed Euler convergence, strong multiplier
continuity and the bounded readout give uniform-in-time L2 convergence of
`H` and `delta`; therefore the sources converge too. Subtracting them
from the convergent actual fields shows that the remainders converge in
L2. An L2 limit of variables bounded in absolute value by `B_Q` has that
same bound: take an almost surely convergent subsequence, obtained by
choosing summable squared errors and applying Markov's inequality.
The analogous statement applies to the forward remainder. Hence at every
deterministic `s<=s_infty`,

\[
 Q_a(s)=\zeta_a(s)+D_a(s),\quad |D_a(s)|\le B_Q,\quad
 \operatorname{Var}\zeta_a(s)=\|\delta_a(s)\|_2^2\le10.            \tag{R17}
\]

The final variance improves from 16 to 10 by (R3). The Gaussian process
retains all cross-time/sample covariances and is independent of the whole
first-row root. No independence of the bounded remainder and the Gaussian
part is asserted. Jointly measurable representatives follow from the L2
continuous approximations; Fubini suffices for all time integrals.

For `R>=B_Q`, (R17) yields the explicit tail estimate

\[
 \sup_{s\le s_\infty,a}
 \|Q_a(s)1_{|Q_a(s)|>R}\|_2
 \le 4(\sqrt{10}+B_Q)
          \exp\!\left(-\frac{(R-B_Q)^2}{80}\right).               \tag{R18}
\]

To verify it, put `sigma=sqrt(10)` and write a standard normal `G`.
The relevant second moment is at most
`E[(sigma |G|+B_Q)² 1_{|G|>(R-B_Q)/sigma}]`.
Use `(u+v)²<=2u²+2v²`,
`1_{|G|>a}<=exp((G²-a²)/4)`,
`E exp(G²/4)=sqrt(2)` and
`E G² exp(G²/4)=2sqrt(2)`; these two Gaussian integrals follow by
completing the square and differentiating its elementary integral.
Taking square roots gives a bound no larger than the right-hand side
of (R18). A smaller actual source variance only decreases the original
dominating second moment under the coupling `zeta=sigma_actual G`.
If `R>=10` the readout tail is zero. Thus (R18) supplies the precise
individual reference tails in C.4.1 (T6); no maximum over training data
or whole circle is needed there.

These constants record a bounded targeted improvement. The elementary
global feature estimate `||A||<=3+S²/2` in the same argument gives a
far larger exponent. Restricting to the proved reference feature endpoint,
using its raw energy path length to obtain (R4), and integrating the
time-dependent stability coefficient reduces it to 2880. The resulting
remainder is still enormous: `log B_Q<2893`. This is a mathematical
certificate, with no claim of a useful-size empirical neighborhood.

## 5. Using actual finite reference GF rather than transformed raw GD

Let `bar theta_n(t)` be the actual finite reference GF, from the stated
Gaussian initialization, including the random readout of variance `1/n²`.
B.1 applies with sum-loss mobilities `kappa_1=kappa_2=kappa_3=1/2`,
which gives exactly the present mean-loss physical equations. Its GF
width conclusion identifies the two active projections, the action
measurements and the readout. The two orthogonal projections determine
the full first row. No infinite-width input-law limit is used here.

For each fixed physical horizon `T`, reference finite GF has a
high-probability bound on the readout supremum, action norm, and all
three raw velocity norms, uniformly on `[0,T]`. One direct source is
finite risk dissipation followed by
`||c'||infinity<=2sqrt(R_n(0))` and the bounded-activation velocity
inequalities. These imply uniform L2 time-Lipschitz bounds for the two
reference backward answers. Indeed

\[
 \dot Q_a=\dot A^*\delta_a+A^*\dot\delta_a,\qquad
 \dot\delta_a=\dot c\,\phi'(Z_a^2)
                    +c\phi''(Z_a^2)\dot Z_a^2,
\]

and
`dot Z_a²=dot A H_a¹+A[phi'(Z_a¹)dot Z_a¹]`.
Every right-hand side has bounded L2 norm using only the stated finite
state and readout-supremum bounds. The population path has the same
continuity. This step needs no Gaussian tail estimate for an input
derivative or root derivative.

Here is a detailed uniform-time tail transfer. Define
`v_R(q)=q-clip_R(q)`; it is 1-Lipschitz. For `R>0`,

\[
 |q|1_{|q|>2R}\le2|v_R(q)|\le2|q|1_{|q|>R}.                    \tag{R19}
\]

At a fixed finite time grid, B.1 gives convergence of the empirical
averages of `|v_R(Q_a)|²`, which are continuous at-most-quadratic
measurements. One may obtain them equally by truncation and the backward
quadratic observable conclusion of that theorem. The time-Lipschitz
estimate extends their RMS norms from the finite grid to every time,
since `| ||v_R(Q(t))||2-||v_R(Q(t_j))||2 |<=||Q(t)-Q(t_j)||2`.
First let width grow at the fixed grid, then refine the grid. From (R18)
and (R19), for every fixed `R>=B_Q` and every positive `epsilon`,

\[
 \Pr\left\{\sup_{t\le T,a}\tau_{2R}(Q_{n,a}(t))
   >8(\sqrt{10}+B_Q)e^{-(R-B_Q)^2/80}+\epsilon\right\}\longrightarrow0.
                                                                    \tag{R20}
\]

The top readout tail vanishes on a high-probability event once its fixed
finite-horizon supremum bound is exceeded. This supplies finite empirical
reference tails for C.4's comparison with arbitrary actual networks.

Using this actual GF reference avoids treating transformed Euler as
exact raw GD. The reference derivative is the raw vector field exactly.
In a comparison with the piecewise affine actual GD path, the sole
algorithmic discrepancy is replacing its preceding state by its current
interpolated state; the raw finite-horizon velocity bound controls that
change. The reference construction's auxiliary meshes are fixed before
width tends to infinity, and removed afterwards. Actual GD steps remain
separate. A sufficient actual-step condition may be retained as
`eta_k sqrt(n_k)->0`, as in B.1; this response component alone claims
neither a rate nor removal of that restriction.

The component concludes a quantitatively bounded Gaussian response tail
for the fixed fitted reference and its finite-GF approximation. It does
not construct a global population flow for perturbed laws, and it does
not claim that whole-circle input derivatives have Gaussian tails.
