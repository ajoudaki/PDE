# Opposite-label reference: fitting, endpoint and explicit hidden activity

Author: `/root/reference`. This is a research proof component, not a promoted
chapter. It uses the canonical common Gaussian action construction in
`docs/special_data_limits.md` III.F.1–10, the sharp action bound in
`docs/global_nonlinear.md` A.3, and the global transformed-flow construction
in that chapter B.1. The full relevant statements and proofs were read.
The new readout-convexity argument below rederives its application in the
present two-input model; the finite three-layer arctangent result in
`finite_optimization_and_controls.md` §2 is not imported by analogy.

## 1. Full state and exact feature equation

Put `u=x/sqrt(2)`. Work on the canonical generated probability spaces
`H_1=L2(Omega_1)` and `H_2=L2(Omega_2)` with the initialized bounded
Gaussian action `A_0:H_1->H_2` and its actual adjoint. Its operator norm is
at most two, by A.3. The full first row is `w=(w_1,w_2)`, initially
`(g_1,g_2)` with independent standard normal coordinates. The population
readout is `c(0)=0`; this is the limit of the specified finite random
readout, not a modification of finite initialization. Write `A=A_0+K`.
The increment metric is

\[
 \|(v,B,d)\|_{\rm raw}^2
 =\|v\|_{L^2(\Omega_1;\mathbb R^2)}^2+\|B\|_{\rm HS}^2+\|d\|_2^2.       \tag{R1}
\]

Only the increment `K` is Hilbert–Schmidt. Its finite counterpart is exactly
`||dW1||F²/n+||dW2||F²+||dW3||²/n`. This follows because rank-one population
operators have finite representative `uv^T/n` and HS norm `||u||2||v||2`.

Let `phi=tanh`, and, for `a=1,2`, write

\[
 Z_a^1=w_a,\quad H_a^1=\phi(w_a),\quad Z_a^2=AH_a^1,\quad
 H_a^2=\phi(Z_a^2).
\]
\[
 y_1=1,\ y_2=-1,\qquad h=\frac12(H_1^2-H_2^2),\quad
 b=\langle c,h\rangle=\frac12(f_1-f_2).
\]

For hidden increments `(v,B)`, define the bounded linear map into `H_2`

\[
 J(v,B)=\frac12\sum_{a=1}^2y_a \phi'(Z_a^2)
              \{BH_a^1+A(\phi'(Z_a^1)v_a)\}.                          \tag{R2}
\]

This is the directional differential of `h`; an unrestricted Frechet
statement for an L2-valued Nemytskii map is neither used nor true in general.
Pairing each term with a fixed `c` and using the actual adjoint gives

\[
 J^*c=\left(
  (\tfrac12y_a \phi'(Z_a^1)A^*(\phi'(Z_a^2)c))_{a=1,2},\quad
  \tfrac12\sum_a y_a(\phi'(Z_a^2)c)\otimes H_a^1\right).               \tag{R3}
\]

The HS adjunction is
`<q tensor v,B>HS=<q,Bv>2`; thus (R3) uses exactly (R1).
Consider the autonomous feature equation

\[
                 c_s=h,\qquad (w,K)_s=J^*c.                  \tag{R4}
\]

It has a unique global solution for every finite feature horizon. Here is
the necessary specialization of B.1, including the change from its sum loss.
Let `j(X,g)` solve `j_X=phi'(j)`, `j(0,g)=g`. Its scalar vector field is
bounded by one and Lipschitz, so it exists for all real `X`. It obeys
`|j(X,g)-j(Y,g)|<=|X-Y|`. Set `w_a=j(X_a,g_a)` and solve

\[
 (X_a)_s=\tfrac12y_a A^*(\phi'(Z_a^2)c),\quad
 K_s=\tfrac12\sum_a y_a(\phi'(Z_a^2)c)\otimes H_a^1,\quad c_s=h.       \tag{R5}
\]

On bounded clock-L2/operator/readout-supremum sets these equations are
Lipschitz in the sum of clock L2, operator norm, and readout L2 distances:
`H1` is Lipschitz in the clock with constant one; `H2` is Lipschitz in its
preactivation; and
`||phi'(Z2)c-phi'(Z2bar)cbar||2<=||c-cbar||2+2||cbar||infty||Z2-Z2bar||2`.
The rank-one difference estimate and bounded action/adjoint then control
all three right sides. The closed readout-supremum condition is complete
in L2 and its integral update preserves an enlarged bound on a short
interval. Contraction of that integral map gives local existence and
uniqueness. Moreover, directly from (R5),

\[
 \|c(s)\|_\infty\le s,\quad \|K(s)\|_{\rm HS}\le s^2/2,
 \quad \|A(s)\|_{\rm op}\le2+s^2/2,
\]
\[
 \|w(s)-w(0)\|_2
 \le {1\over\sqrt2}\int_0^s(2+v^2/2)v\,dv.                  \tag{R6}
\]

The same bound holds for the clock norm in the last display. These
polynomials prevent escape from the required bounded sets on every finite
horizon; the integrated equations give a strong limit at a finite proposed
endpoint and the same local construction extends it. Rank-one continuity
upgrades `K` to a strongly C1 HS curve. Bounded-multiplier continuity
upgrades `w` to a strongly C1 L2 curve and proves (R4). Conversely, the
scalar equation `w_s=B(s)phi'(w)` has the unique representation
`j(integral B,g)`: Fubini makes `B` integrable at almost every coordinate,
and the scalar integral Lipschitz inequality gives uniqueness. Thus these
are the actual raw feature equations, not an alternative optimizer.

The Gaussian action used here is the canonical common action of B.1:
countably many finite generated programs, their finite unions, both matrix
orientations, and passive input probes are realized jointly before
completion. Continuous at-most-linear value instructions `j` are admitted
by A.1. The same-root Lipschitz estimate just given supplies the empirical
feedback passage. No bounded derivative with respect to the Gaussian root
is required. At a current state, resetting clock zero and retaining the
current raw fields/action gives the same unique continuation, so the raw
reference is autonomous and restartable. This construction supplies a
complete actual-state endpoint characterization below; it encodes no
future trained trajectory in its coefficients.

## 2. Symmetry, fitting, and the two clocks

Let `P(u_1,u_2)=(u_2,u_1)`. The raw transformation
`(w,A,c)->(wP,A,-c)` maps predictions to `-f(Pu)`. Direct substitution in
(R3)–(R4) shows that it preserves the feature vector field, since `h`
changes sign and the two labels exchange signs. It also preserves the
physical vector field for the probability law
`nu_*=1/2 delta_(e1,+1)+1/2 delta_(e2,-1)` in normalized inputs.
The initial full-row Gaussian law is invariant under swapping its two
coordinates; the independent initialized matrix law is unchanged and
`c0=0` changes to itself. At the generated-action level this statement is
obtained by adjoining the swapped version of every finite program to the
same countable construction. Finite joint laws are invariant; hence the
coordinate swap is a probability-space isometry that respects coordinate
operations, the action and its adjoint. The unique integral construction
commutes with it. Therefore the deterministic predictions satisfy

\[
                 f(Pu)=-f(u),\qquad f_1=b=-f_2.                \tag{R7}
\]

This is symmetry of the population action law, not pointwise symmetry of a
particular finite initialized network. No such finite symmetry is assumed.
Oddness of both activations also gives `f(-u)=-f(u)`.

For the mean squared loss the reference residuals are `(b-1,1-b)`.
The exact physical equations of C.4.1 therefore equal `2(1-b)` times
(R4). The correct clock is

\[
                 {ds\over dt}=2(1-b),\qquad s(0)=0.           \tag{R8}
\]

To prove that this clock is legitimate through all physical times, first
work with the globally defined feature equation. The strong curve chain
rule gives `h_s=J(w,K)_s`. Indeed bounded continuous multiplication is
strongly continuous on a fixed L2 vector after truncating that vector;
the scalar fundamental theorem of calculus then proves
`(phi(z))_s=phi'(z)z_s` for strongly C1 L2 curves. Differentiating a bounded
operator times a strongly C1 vector by adding and subtracting its factors
gives the ordinary product rule. Applied successively to (R2) this gives

\[
 c_{ss}=JJ^*c,\qquad
 b_s=\|h\|_2^2+\|J^*c\|_{\rm hidden}^2
                  =\|\theta_s\|_{\rm raw}^2.                 \tag{R9}
\]

The metric in the second term is the row-L2 plus HS hidden metric from
(R1). No derivative of `J` is taken in (R9).

Set `m=||h(0)||2²`. Initially the two first features are independent odd
functions of independent standard normals, so their Gram is `q I_2`, where

\[
 q=E\tanh^2G,\qquad v=E\tanh^2(\sqrt qG),\qquad m=v/2.        \tag{R10}
\]

The initial second preactivations are independent `N(0,q)` by the initial
forward Gaussian law. The elementary certificate in §5 proves

\[
                         m\ge m_0:=1/10.                     \tag{R11}
\]

On every interval where `g=||c||2>0`, differentiating its scalar norm gives

\[
 g_s=b/g,\qquad
 g_{ss}=\frac{\|h\|_2^2-(g_s)^2+\|J^*c\|_{\rm hidden}^2}{g}
                                                          \ge0.\tag{R12}
\]

Cauchy–Schwarz gives the inequality. Since `c(s)=s h(0)+o_L2(s)` and
`h(s)->h(0)`, one has `g_s(0+)=sqrt(m)`. Consequently on its first
positive interval `g_s>=sqrt(m)` and `g>=s sqrt(m)`. It cannot reach zero
again at a positive endpoint, so this interval is all positive feature
times. Again by Cauchy–Schwarz, `||h||2>=g_s`, and (R9) gives

\[
                         b_s\ge m\ge m_0.                    \tag{R13}
\]

Hence there is exactly one first feature time `s_dagger` with `b=1`, and
`0<s_dagger<=1/m<=10`. On `[0,s_dagger)`, define

\[
 t(s)=\int_0^s\frac{dv}{2(1-b(v))}.                           \tag{R14}
\]

Its integrand is positive. Since `b_s` is continuous and bounded on the
compact feature interval `[0,s_dagger]`, say by `K`,
`1-b(s)<=K(s_dagger-s)`; thus the integral diverges as
`s->s_dagger`. Its inverse is defined for every `t>=0` and obeys (R8).
It is the unique B.1 physical reference by uniqueness of the original raw
equation. Writing `e(t)=1-b(s(t))`, differentiation gives

\[
 e_t=-2b_s e,\quad 0<e(t)\le e^{-2m t}\le e^{-t/5},\qquad
 R_{\nu_*}(f_*(t))=e(t)^2\le e^{-2t/5}.                       \tag{R15}
\]

There is no finite physical time at which the residual first vanishes:
the displayed linear scalar equation with locally bounded coefficient
and initial value one keeps it positive. This also checks the clock sign.

## 3. Actual endpoint and uniform prediction convergence

By (R9) and Cauchy–Schwarz, for `0<=s_1<=s_2<=s_dagger`,

\[
 \|\theta(s_2)-\theta(s_1)\|_{\rm raw}
 \le\sqrt{(s_2-s_1)(b(s_2)-b(s_1))}.                          \tag{R16}
\]

The state is already globally defined in feature time. Its endpoint is
precisely the solution of (R4)–(R5) stopped at the uniquely characterized
first level `b=1`; denote it `(w_dagger,A_dagger,c_dagger)`. Define on the
whole circle

\[
 f_*^\infty(\sqrt2u)
 =\langle c_\dagger,\tanh(A_\dagger\tanh(w_\dagger\cdot u))\rangle.
                                                                  \tag{R17}
\]

Thus (R17) is a characterization through the actual autonomous dynamics,
including its initialized Gaussian action and adjoint. It is not merely a
name for an unknown prediction limit. It gives `f∞(sqrt2 e1)=1`,
`f∞(sqrt2 e2)=-1` and the two symmetries in (R7).

Equations (R13),(R16) imply

\[
 s_\dagger-s(t)\le e(t)/m,\qquad
 \|\theta(s(t))-\theta(s_\dagger)\|_{\rm raw}\le e(t)/\sqrt m.
                                                                  \tag{R18}
\]

In particular throughout this interval

\[
 \|c\|_2\le\sqrt{10},\quad \|A\|_{op}\le2+\sqrt{10},\quad
 \|w\|_2\le\sqrt2+\sqrt{10},\quad \|c\|_\infty\le10.           \tag{R19}
\]

For any `|u|=1`, strong directional differentiation and the same
adjunction as above give three raw gradient blocks for `f(u)` with norms
at most `||A||op||c||2`, `||c||2`, and one, respectively. Equivalently,
add and subtract the three endpoint factors and use the one-Lipschitz
activations. The straight segment between two reference states retains
(R19). Integrating the scalar derivative along this segment proves

\[
 \sup_{|u|=1}|f_\theta(u)-f_{\bar\theta}(u)|
 \le C\|\theta-\bar\theta\|_{\rm raw},\quad
 C=\sqrt{1+10\{1+(2+\sqrt{10})^2\}}<17.                       \tag{R20}
\]

This holds simultaneously for all inputs; no finite grid substitutes for
the circle. Combining it with (R15),(R18),

\[
 \sup_{x\in\sqrt2S^1}|f_*(t,x)-f_*^\infty(x)|
 \le 17\sqrt{10}\,e^{-t/5}.                                  \tag{R21}
\]

The explicit choice

\[
                              T=40                           \tag{R22}
\]

therefore has endpoint error less than `1/32`: `17 sqrt(10)e^-8<.019<1/32`.
Its reference risk is at most `e^-16<1/1024`. These are strict margins.
For example the elementary Taylor lower sum for `e^8` already proves the
stated inequalities, so no numerical solver for the trained flow is used.

Input regularity also follows directly from the full-row norm:

\[
 |f_\theta(\sqrt2u)-f_\theta(\sqrt2v)|
 \le\sqrt{10}(2+\sqrt{10})(\sqrt2+\sqrt{10})|u-v|<76|u-v|.    \tag{R23}
\]

The endpoint satisfies the same estimate. Also `||f||infty<=sqrt10`.
For binary labels, `(f(u)-y)^2` is therefore Lipschitz in the prescribed
joint transport cost with constant at most
`2(sqrt10+1) max(76,1)<633`; use
`|(a-y)^2-(b-z)^2|<=2(sqrt10+1)(|a-b|+|y-z|)`.
This proves the exact input regularity needed for risk transport.

For a general target error `epsilon>0`, the same reference component gives
`T(epsilon)=max(0,5 log(17 sqrt10/epsilon))`. Changed-law radii for this
choice remain a separate comparison conclusion and may shrink with epsilon.

## 4. Both hidden activations move at the fixed time 1/200

This section uses the actual opposite-label reference and retains paired
initial/current observations. Put `Y_a=A0 H0_a^1`; let

\[
 h_0=(\tanh Y_1-\tanh Y_2)/2,\quad
 U_a=h_0\phi'(Y_a),\quad P_a=A_0^*U_a,\quad
 V_a=\phi'(g_a)^2P_a,
\]
\[
 R_a=qU_a+A_0V_a,\qquad
 a_0=E\phi'(G)^4,\quad r_0=E\phi'(\sqrt qG)^2.                \tag{R24}
\]

All fields are typed: `U,R` live in layer two, and `P,V` in layer one.
The Gaussian integration certificate proves `q>.39`, `q<.4`,
`v>.2`, `a0>.3`, and `r0>.6`.

Here is a complete fixed initial reuse calculation establishing positivity
and the needed moments. Let `C_ab=E[U_a U_b]`. Gaussian conditioning on
the first two forward calls gives

\[
 P_a=\sum_{b=1}^2p_{ab}\tanh g_b+\Gamma_a,\quad
 p_{ab}=E[Y_bU_a]/q,\quad \Gamma\sim N(0,C),                  \tag{R25}
\]

independently of `(g1,g2)`. This is the actual transpose response, not a
fresh-matrix replacement. For completeness, the finite conditional
Gaussian matrix has its mean fixed on the two forward query directions
and independent Gaussian randomness on their orthogonal complement.
Applying its transpose to `U` gives the first term in (R25) and a Gaussian
with covariance `E[UU^T]`; projections onto the finitely many old first
query directions have expected squared RMS `O(1/n)` and disappear.
The joint initial forward Gram is `q I`, so no inverse at a degeneracy is
involved here. Bounded smooth `U(Y)` permits the fixed-program law and
contractions. Truncating the products by bounded gates and using their
fixed Gaussian moment envelopes permits the same conclusion for `V`.

The matrix `C` is positive definite. If `z1 U1+z2 U2=0` almost surely,
Gaussian full support and continuity give
`(tanh Y1-tanh Y2)(z1 phi'(Y1)+z2 phi'(Y2))=0` everywhere.
On the dense open set `Y1!=Y2` the second factor vanishes and continuity
extends this identity everywhere. Varying each coordinate and using the
nonconstant function `phi'` forces `z1=z2=0`.

Let `alpha_b=E[H0_b^1 V_a]/q`,
`V_a^perp=V_a-sum alpha_b H0_b^1`, and
`sigma_a²=E[(V_a^perp)²]`. Conditioning the same Gaussian matrix on the
forward calls and the reverse calls in (R25) gives

\[
 A_0 V_a=\sum_b\alpha_bY_b+\bar d\,U_a+\sigma_a\gamma_a,
 \quad \bar d=E\phi'(G)^2,                                  \tag{R26}
\]

where `gamma_a` is standard normal independent of the old layer-two
coordinates, for each fixed `a`. Independence between `gamma1,gamma2`
is not claimed. To verify the response coefficient, the conditional
matrix formula gives `C^-1 E[P V_a^perp]` for the coefficient of `U`.
The deterministic part of each `P_b` is in the span of the first forward
inputs and pairs to zero with `V_a^perp`. The remaining pairing is
`E[Gamma_b Gamma_a] E phi'(G)^2=C_ba bar d`; multiplication by `C^-1`
gives `bar d` in coordinate `a`. The unused Gaussian input variance is
`sigma_a²`. Its finite output projection off the two old reverse input
directions again has vanishing RMS. These calculations prove (R26)
without suppressing either reused response term.

Conditional variance in (R25) and projection off functions of the roots
give

\[
 \|V_a\|_2^2\ge C_{aa}a_0,\qquad
 \sigma_a^2\ge C_{aa}a_0,\qquad
 \|\phi'(Y_a)R_a\|_2^2\ge C_{aa}a_0 r_0.                    \tag{R27}
\]

The last inequality conditions on the old second-layer coordinates in
(R26); all its other terms are functions of those coordinates. By
independence and oddness of the initial `Y1,Y2`,

\[
 C_{aa}=\tfrac14 E[(\tanh^2Y_a+v)\phi'(Y_a)^2]
                          \ge vr_0/4>3/100.                  \tag{R28}
\]

Thus each of the two first-order-in-`s²` coefficients has norm at least

\[
 \tfrac14\|V_a\|_2>1/100,\qquad
 \tfrac14\|\phi'(Y_a)R_a\|_2>1/100.                          \tag{R29}
\]

For explicit remainder bounds, (R25) gives `sum_b|p_ab|<=2/sqrt q<4`
and `Caa<=1`. It can be coupled so that `|P_a|<=4+|G|`, and hence
`||P_a||4<6`. For `R>=8` and `z=R-4`, the elementary Gaussian tail
integration yields

\[
 \tau_R(P_a):=\|P_a1_{|P_a|>R}\|_2
 \le\{(4z+68/z)e^{-z^2/2}\}^{1/2}.                           \tag{R30}
\]

Indeed `(|G|+4)^2<=2G²+32`,
`Pr(|G|>z)<=2phi_G(z)/z`, and
`E[G²1_|G|>z]<=2(z+1/z)phi_G(z)`; then drop the density factor
`1/sqrt(2pi)<1`. At `R=10`, the right side is less than `1/1000`.
By bounded action `||V_a||2<=||P_a||2<=2`.
In (R26), the Gaussian linear term has L4 norm at most
`3^(1/4)||V_a||2<3`, the fresh Gaussian term has L4 norm below three,
and `(q+bar d)U_a` has supremum at most two. Therefore `||R_a||4<8`.

We now prove an explicit small-feature-time expansion using only these
fixed initial tails. For `0<=s<=1`, (R6) gives

\[
 \|A\|_{op}\le5/2,\quad \|c\|_\infty\le s,\quad
 \|K\|_{HS}\le s^2/2,\quad
 \|w_a-g_a\|_2\le5s^2/8,
\]
\[
 \|Z_a^2-Y_a\|_2\le7s^2/4,\quad
 \|c-sh_0\|_2\le7s^3/12,\quad
 \|\phi'(Z_a^2)c-sU_a\|_2\le5s^3,
\]
\[
                  \|A^*(\phi'(Z_a^2)c)-sP_a\|_2\le11s^3.           \tag{R31}
\]

For the middle line, `H1` and `H2` are one-Lipschitz, so
`||h(s)-h0||2<=7s²/4`; integrate and then use the two-Lipschitz
second gate. The last line uses `||A||<=5/2`, `||K||<=s²/2`
and the sharper `49s³/12` bound preceding the rounded `5s³`.

Truncate the *fixed initial* `P_a` at `R`. Then

\[
 \|(\phi'(Z_a^1(s))-\phi'(g_a))P_a\|_2
 \le(5R/4)s^2+2\tau_R(P_a).
\]

Subtract `y_a s phi'(g_a)P_a/2` from the first raw feature velocity in
(R3), integrate, and use (R31). The preactivation remainder is bounded by
`(44+5R)s^4/32+tau_R(P_a)s²/2`. For the activation, compare first with
the artificial increment `y_a s² phi'(g_a)P_a/4`; its scalar tanh Taylor
remainder has L2 norm at most `s^4||P_a||4²/16`, since `|phi''|<=2`.
Consequently

\[
 \|H_a^1(s)-H_a^1(0)-y_as^2V_a/4\|_2
 \le\tfrac12\tau_R(P_a)s^2+{116+5R\over32}s^4.                \tag{R32}
\]

The middle velocity differs from
`(s/2)sum y_a U_a tensor H_a^1(0)` by at most `45s³/8` in HS norm:
use (R31), `||U||2<=1`, and `||H1-H10||2<=5s²/8`.
After integration its remainder is at most `45s^4/32`.
Expanding `(A0+K)(H10+Delta H1)` now gives
`Z2_a-Y_a=y_as²(q U_a+A0V_a)/4` with remainder at most
`tau_R(P_a)s²+[2(116+5R)/32+55/32]s^4`. The `55/32` consists of
`45/32` from the middle increment and `5/16` from `K Delta H1`.
The scalar tanh remainder adds `s^4||R_a||4²/16<=4s^4`. Thus

\[
 \|H_a^2(s)-H_a^2(0)-y_as^2\phi'(Y_a)R_a/4\|_2
 \le\tau_R(P_a)s^2+{415+10R\over32}s^4.                      \tag{R33}
\]

At `R=10` and `s<=1/100`, (R29)–(R33) show, for both layers and each
reference input,

\[
           \|H_a^\ell(s)-H_a^\ell(0)\|_2\ge s^2/200.         \tag{R34}
\]

In fact the error coefficient is at most
`.001+(515/32)10^-4<.003<.005`, strictly below half the coefficient
lower bound `.01`.

Choose the fixed **physical** time

\[
                       t_{\rm act}=1/200.                   \tag{R35}
\]

Since `||c(s)||2<=s` and `||h||2<=1`, one has `0<=b(s)<=s`
before the level `b=1`. The clock therefore satisfies
`1-e^-2t<=s(t)<=2t`. At (R35),
`199/20000<=s(t_act)<=1/100`; the lower bound uses
`1-e^-a>=a-a²/2`. Hence the paired RMS averaged over the reference law,

\[
 D_{\ell,*}(t)=\left\{\frac12\sum_{a=1}^2
 E_\ell|H_a^\ell(t)-H_a^\ell(0)|^2\right\}^{1/2},
\]

obeys the explicit strict margin

\[
              D_{\ell,*}(t_{\rm act})>1/2{,}500{,}000,
              \qquad \ell=1,2.                              \tag{R36}
\]

The average uses paired initial and current coordinates on the same layer
population. It is not the Wasserstein distance between separate marginals.
By B.1 the reference finite networks retain this paired observable:
with their actual random initial readout, widths tending to infinity and
actual steps satisfying `eta sqrt(n)->0`, its finite squared value
`(2n)^-1 sum_(a,i)|h_ai^ell(t)-h_ai^ell(0)|²` converges in probability
to `D_(ell,*)²` at this physical time. In particular its RMS exceeds half
(R36) with probability tending to one. Whole-circle law perturbation and
averaging under a nearby `mu`, or its empirical laws, require the separate
transport component; (R36) supplies the positive reference margin for it.
No claim of displacement at time `T=40` is needed or made here.

## 5. Reproducible rational Gaussian certificate

This is deterministic constant evaluation, not a training experiment.
For `0<=x<=18`, put `S80(x)=sum_(j=0)^80 x^j/j!`. Then

\[
 S_{80}(x)\le e^x\le S_{80}(x)
       +{x^{81}/81!\over1-x/82}.                             \tag{R37}
\]

The upper remainder follows because every subsequent term ratio is at
most `x/82<1`. Quadrature arguments are at most eight; the separate
initial-tail verification uses argument eighteen. Partition `[0,4]` into 1,000 intervals of width `1/250`.
The Gaussian density decreases there and its value at zero lies between
`.3988` and `.3990`; the program certifies the two squared inequalities
using rational alternating bounds for
`pi=16 arctan(1/5)-4 arctan(1/239)`. This identity follows from the tangent
addition formula: `tan(4 arctan(1/5))=120/119`, so subtracting
`arctan(1/239)` gives tangent one at an angle in `(0,pi/2)`.
The alternating arctangent remainder bounds follow by integrating the
finite geometric identity for `1/(1+x²)` from zero to each positive
argument. Use tanh at left endpoints and density at right
endpoints for lower bounds on increasing squared tanh. For decreasing
powers of sech, both right endpoints give lower bounds. For the upper
bound on `q`, use the opposite endpoints and add `1/10000`; the missing
two-sided Gaussian tail beyond four is at most `2phi_G(4)/4<1/10000`.
The function `(E-1)/(E+1)` increases for `E>=1`, whereas
`4E/(E+1)^2` decreases there. Thus (R37) supplies rational bounds for
all required gates. Since `.624²<.39` and `.633²>.4`, the resulting lower
bounds imply the exact `v,a0,r0` bounds used above.

The following complete Python program uses exact rational arithmetic,
rounding each summand outward to denominator `10^12` to prevent growth of
unneeded common denominators. Its assertions are exact integer/rational
comparisons. Decimal output is only a readable summary.
