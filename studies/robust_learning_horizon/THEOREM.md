# Robust whole-circle prediction after substantial learning

Candidate theorem by /root, /root/reference and /root/response. Complete
component proofs are REFERENCE.md, RESPONSE.md and TRANSFER.md. Acceptance
requires two fresh complete independent reviews of the frozen packet.
The result is fixed-accuracy transfer from one globally controlled reference.

## Exact statement

Use two tanh hidden layers of common width n, input dimension two, no biases,
and the stored-weight forward map
\[
 z^1=W^1x/\sqrt2,\quad h^1=\tanh z^1,\quad
 z^2=W^2h^1,\quad h^2=\tanh z^2,\quad f_n=(W^3)^Th^2/n.
\]
Initialize all entries/blocks independently, centered Gaussian with variances
(1,1/n,1/n²). Train all blocks with mobilities (n,1,n), unhalved mean squared
loss and physical time. Raw GD updates all stored blocks from the preceding
state; interpolate raw weights linearly and recompute activations.
The actual finite initial readout is retained.

Let Z=sqrt(2)S¹ x {-1,+1}, with joint transport cost
|x-x'|/sqrt(2)+|y-y'|, and set
\[
 \nu_*=\tfrac12\delta_{(\sqrt2e_1,1)}
       +\tfrac12\delta_{(\sqrt2e_2,-1)},\qquad
 T=40,\qquad \delta=\exp\{-\exp(3000)\}.                         \tag{1}
\]

The population reference has a unique global autonomous flow on its canonical
Gaussian action spaces. Its whole-circle predictor tends to a continuous
limit f_*^infinity. To characterize this endpoint, solve the autonomous
feature equation in REFERENCE.md (R4)–(R5), starting from the full independent
standard Gaussian first row, the actual initialized middle Gaussian action
and its adjoint, and zero limiting readout. Stop at the unique first feature
time s_dagger at which b=<c,(H2_1-H2_2)/2>=1; evaluate that state on every
circle input. Then 0<s_dagger<=10, and
\[
 \sup_x|f_*(t,x)-f_*^\infty(x)|\le17\sqrt{10}e^{-t/5},\qquad
 R_{\nu_*}(f_*(t))\le e^{-2t/5}.                               \tag{2}
\]
The endpoint interpolates the reference labels, is odd under x->-x, and
satisfies f∞(Px)=-f∞(x) when P swaps input coordinates. Its input Lipschitz
constant in x/sqrt(2) is less than 76. This specifies the selected prediction
through the actual dynamics; it asserts no uniqueness among interpolants.

For every fixed law mu with W1(mu,nu_*)<delta, let lambda_k be any deterministic
empirical laws converging to mu in W1. Their observation counts, support
degeneracies and atom weights have no further restrictions. Take n_k->infinity
and eta_k>0 with eta_k sqrt(n_k)->0; put t_k=floor(T/eta_k)eta_k. Then
\[
 \Pr\left\{
 \sup_{x\in\sqrt2S^1}|f_{n_k,\eta_k,\lambda_k}(t_k,x)-f_*^\infty(x)|\le1/4,\
 R_\mu(f_{n_k,\eta_k,\lambda_k}(t_k))\le1/4,\
 R_{\lambda_k}(f_{n_k,\eta_k,\lambda_k}(t_k))\le1/4
 \right\}\longrightarrow1.                                   \tag{3}
\]
Probability here is over initialization. The same conclusion holds for iid
samples of any sizes m_k->infinity from the fixed mu, independent of
initialization, with probability over both samples and initialization.
There is no relative sample/width growth restriction or finite-width rate.
The displayed GD condition is sufficient; no removal is required.

At the fixed physical time t_act=1/200 define the paired, training-averaged
squared RMS displacement
\[
 J_{\ell,k}(t)=\int_Z\frac1{n_k}
 \|h^\ell_{n_k,\eta_k,\lambda_k}(t,x)
                 -h^\ell_{n_k,\lambda_k}(0,x)\|_2^2\,d\lambda_k(x,y).
                                                                    \tag{4}
\]
The two times use the same network and neuron indices, not a coupling chosen
between marginal laws. In both deterministic and iid settings,
\[
 \Pr\{J_{1,k}(t_{\rm act})\ge10^{-13},\
       J_{2,k}(t_{\rm act})\ge10^{-13}\}\longrightarrow1.        \tag{5}
\]
Thus both paired RMS norms exceed sqrt(10^-13) independently of width/sample
count. This holds jointly with (3). One may replace t_act by its preceding
GD node, by the same bounded-velocity estimate. No displacement at T is
claimed. The opposite-label reference itself has each averaged paired RMS
strictly greater than 1/2500000 at t_act.

## Strict numerical margins and transfer

The exact rational Gaussian certificate gives m>=1/10. The reference proof
gives
\[
 17\sqrt{10}e^{-8}<.019<1/32,\qquad e^{-16}<1/1024.             \tag{6}
\]
In TRANSFER.md choose
\[
 B=12,\quad K=40000000,\quad d_0=10^{-18},\quad R=e^{2900},\quad
 M_Q=225400e^{2880}+180,\quad H=16(4+M_Q).                     \tag{7}
\]
The elementary bounds M_Q<e^2893, H<e^2897, K<e^18,
1+R<e^2901 and R²/4096>e^5791 give R>4M_Q+20 and R>101. Therefore
\[
 \log\{KH e^{K(1+R)-R^2/4096}\}
 <2915+e^{2919}-e^{5791}<-100,
\]
\[
 \log\{K(1+R)e^{K(1+R)}\delta\}
 <2919+e^{2919}-e^{3000}<-100.                                \tag{8}
\]
For example e>2 already separates the last exponentials by far more than
3019. Also e^-100<10^-18/4, using the single positive term 100^16/16! in
the series for e^100. These are the two strict bounds in TRANSFER.md (15).
The same estimates give
\[
 L_{\rm risk}\delta<1/256,\quad 8B^2\delta<10^{-18},
 \qquad L_{\rm risk}=44928.                                  \tag{9}
\]

Compare actual GD to actual finite GF on nu_* with the same initialized
arrays. Since limsup W1(lambda_k,nu_*)<delta, the stopped comparison gives
\[
 \left(\sup_{t\le40}D_{n_k}(\theta_{GD,k}(t),\bar\theta_{n_k}(t))
                                       -d_0/2\right)_+
 \longrightarrow0\quad\hbox{in probability}.                 \tag{10}
\]
Its complete proof, including the finite actual-state bounds, initial
readout, reference tails, auxiliary-mesh order and stopping argument, is
TRANSFER.md. The reference is raw GF, so its raw-field defect is zero.
Transformed Euler is used only as an auxiliary width-identification tool.

Whole-circle reference convergence and the full-state estimates imply
\[
 \left(\sup_x|f_k(T,x)-f_*^\infty(x)|-1/16\right)_+
 \longrightarrow0\quad\hbox{in probability},                 \tag{11}
\]
because the deterministic bound is .019+B²d0<1/16. The circle extension uses
the full first row and uniform input Lipschitz bounds. Replacing T by t_k
costs at most a fixed state-speed/prediction constant times eta_k.
The finite predictor is bounded by 12 and Lipschitz in normalized input
with constant 1728 on the comparison event. Its squared-loss integrand has
joint Lipschitz constant Lrisk. At the reference atoms f∞ equals the label.
Thus (9),(11) give
\[
 (R_\mu(f_k(t_k))-1/128)_+\longrightarrow0,\quad
 (R_{\lambda_k}(f_k(t_k))-1/128)_+\longrightarrow0
                      \quad\hbox{in probability}.            \tag{12}
\]
The two deterministic contributions are (1/16)² and Lrisk delta<1/256;
for the empirical risk use W1(lambda_k,nu_*)<=delta+o(1). These strict
bounds prove (3), not just convergence to its thresholds. Both limiting
initial binary-label risks are one, because the initial predictor is
uniformly bounded by the vanishing readout RMS.

For activity, changing the evolved state with initialization fixed changes
the paired squared-displacement integrand by at most 4(B+1)D_n. Changing
its input changes it by at most 8B²|u-v|. These follow from displacement
RMS<=2 and the forward input/state bounds in TRANSFER.md. Coupling lambda_k
to nu_*, retaining the separate paired-observable reference convergence,
and using its strict RMS margin gives
\[
 J_{\ell,k}(t_{\rm act})\ge(1/2500000)^2-2(B+1)d_0-8B^2\delta
                                            -o_{\mathbb P}(1).       \tag{13}
\]
The deterministic right side exceeds 1.59*10^-13, proving (5) with slack.
The opposite-label activity computation is proved anew in REFERENCE.md;
C.4's equal-label example is not substituted for it.

For iid samples, compact Borel partitions and the variance bound for each
empirical cell mass prove W1(lambda_k,mu)->0 in probability, as detailed
in TRANSFER.md. Its other random events involve only the fixed reference
and initialization. Union bounds give (3),(5) in joint probability.
Each claim is for every fixed mu and sequence. No uniform failure probability
over laws, almost-sure joint limit, global population flow for mu or endpoint
for mu is asserted.

## Geometric meaning, scale and limitations

An admitted nonorthogonal law moves the second reference input by the angle
a=delta/2, retaining its label and the first atom. Its cost is at most
a/2=delta/4; the off-diagonal input Gram is -sin(a), which is nonzero.

For an admitted nonatomic law replace each input atom by uniform arc length
on the arc of angular radius a=delta/4 around it, retaining its associated
label, and then flip each binary label independently with probability
p=delta/8. The coupling costs at most a+2p=delta/2<delta. More generally
a+2p<delta suffices; arbitrary extra contamination of mass rho costs at most
4rho. Thus no orthogonality, two-atom, Gram-inverse or weight-lower-bound
condition is imposed on perturbed laws.

The explicit radius is mathematically positive, but extremely small:
\[
 \log_{10}(1/\delta)=e^{3000}/\log 10,\qquad
 \log_{10}\log_{10}(1/\delta)
 =3000/\log 10-\log_{10}(\log10)\approx1302.52.
\]
This is far below a practically useful neighborhood. The dominant loss is
the fresh-root stability exponential followed by a cutoff comparison.
A bounded targeted improvement used the reference energy path length and
integrated a time-dependent coefficient, reducing the response exponent
to 2880. Its conservatism is likely substantial; its sharpness is not
assessed by this proof. No training experiment or parameter sweep was run.

The theorem establishes whole-circle robustness after substantial risk
reduction for an open family with nonlinear moving hidden features. It
does not show that feature motion causes that reduction, superiority to
linear or frozen-feature learning, or useful risk on a uniform-circle
teacher distribution. It gives no arbitrary-accuracy guarantee for one
fixed perturbed law. A radius shrinking with accuracy would not give that
stronger conclusion.
